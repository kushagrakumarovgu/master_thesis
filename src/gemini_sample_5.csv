"The paper address the problem of detecting if an example is misclassified or out-of-distribution. This is an very important topic and the study provides a good baseline. Although it misses strong novel methods for the task, the study contributes to the community.","The review is mostly positive. It highlights the relevance of the topic and acknowledges the contribution to the community. However, it also mentions the lack of strong novel methods, which slightly decreases the positivity. Overall, the tone is neutral and professional, without using overly negative or enthusiastic language.",60,50
"This paper proposed a compare-aggregate model for the NLP tasks that require semantically comparing the text sequences, such as question answering and textual entailment. The basic framework of this model is to apply a convolutional neural network (aggregation) after a element-wise operation (comparison) over the attentive outputs of the LSTMs. The highlighted part is the comparison, where this paper compares several different methods for matching text sequences, and the element-wise subtraction/multiplication operations are demonstrated to achieve generally better performance on four different datasets. While the weak point is that this is an incremental work and a bit lack of innovation. A qualitative evaluation about how subtraction, multiplication and other comparison functions perform on varied kinds of sentences would be more interesting.","The review acknowledges the merits of the paper's approach (""generally better performance on four different datasets"") but points out a lack of significant novelty (""incremental work"", ""a bit lack of innovation""). This suggests a somewhat mixed but overall leaning towards the positive side.",40,70

"CONTRIBUTIONS This paper extends end-to-end CNN+RNN image captioning model with auxiliary attribute predictions. It proposes five variants of network architectures, which take the attribute/image features in alternating orders or at every timestamp. The attributes (i.e., 1,000 most common words on COCO) are obtained by attribute classifiers trained by a multiple instance learning approach. The experiment results indicated that having these attributes as input improves captioning performance on standard metrics, including BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr-D. NOVELTY + SIGNIFICANCE All five variants of the network architectures, shown in Fig. 1, have followed a standard seq-to-seq LSTM model. The differences between these variants come from two aspects: 1. the order of image/attribute inputs; 2. whether to input attribute/image features at each time step. No architectural changes have been added to the proposed model over a standard seq-to-seq model. The proposed approach achieves decent performance improvement over previous work, but the technical novelty of this work is significantly limited by existing work that used similar ideas. In particular, Fang et al. 2015 and You et al. 2016 have both used attributes for image captioning. This work has used the same multiple instance learning procedure as Fang et al. 2015 to train visual detectors for common words and used detector outputs as conditional inputs to a language model. In addition, the idea of using image feature as input to every RNN timestamp has been widely explored, for instance, in Donahue et al. 2015. The authors did not offer a clear explanation about the technical contribution of this work over these existing approaches. CLARITY First, it is not clear to me which image features have been used by the baseline methods. As the baselines may rely on different image representations, the experiments would not offer a completely fair comparison. For example, the results of the attention-based models in Table 1 are directly copied from Xu et al., 2015, which were reported with Oxford VGG features, instead of GoogLeNet used by LSTM-A. Even if the baselines do not use the same types of features, it should at least be explicitly mentioned. Besides, the fact that the results of Table 1 and Table 2 are reported with different features (GoogLeNet v.s. ResNet) are not described clearly in the paper. “We select 1,000 most common words on COCO…” How would this approach guarantee that the selected attributes have clear semantic meanings, as many words among the top 1000 would be stop words, abstract nouns, non-visual verbs, etc.? It would be interesting to perform some quantitative analysis to see whether these 1000-dimensional attribute vectors actually carry semantic meanings, or merely capture biases of word distributions from the ground-truth captions. One possible way to justify the importance of semantic attributes is to experiment with ground-truth attributes or attribute classifiers trained on annotated sources such as COCO-Attribute (Patterson et al. 2016) or Visual Genome (Krishna et al. 2016). EXPERIMENTS It would be interesting to analyze how the behavior of the seq-to-seq model changes with respect to the additional attribute inputs. My hypothesis is that the model’s word choices will shift towards words with high scores. This experiments will help us understand how the model can take advantage of the auxiliary attribute inputs. Since the attributes are selected as the most frequent words from COCO, it is likely for the model to overfit the metrics, such as BLEU, that rely on word matching. On the other hand, it has been shown that these automatic caption evaluation metrics do not necessarily correlate with human judgment. Therefore, I think it is necessary to conduct a human study to convince the readers the quality improvement of the proposed model is not caused by overfitting to metrics. SUMMARY This paper demonstrates that image captioning can be improved by having attributes as auxiliary inputs. However, the model has minor novelty given existing work that has explored similar ideas. Besides, more analysis is necessary to demonstrate the semantic meanings of attributes. A human study is recommended to justify the actual performance improvement. Given these points to be improved, I would recommend rejecting this paper in its current form.","The review acknowledges the paper's contributions but highlights a lack of significant novelty and raises concerns about the methodology.

"Summary: The paper presents an approach – Neural Answer Construction Model for the task of answering non-factoid questions, in particular, love-advice questions. The two main features of the proposed model are the following – 1) it incorporates the biases of semantics behind questions into word embeddings, 2) in addition to optimizing for closeness between questions and answers, it also optimizes for optimum combination of sentences in the predicted answer. The proposed model is evaluated using the dataset from a Japanese online QA service and is shown to outperform the baseline model (Tan et al. 2015) by 20% relatively (6% absolutely). The paper also experiments with few other baseline models (ablations of the proposed model). Strengths: 1. The two motivations behind the proposed approach – need to understand the ambiguous use of words depending on context, and need to generate new answers rather than just selecting from answers held by QA sites – are reasonable. 2. The novelty in the paper involves the following – 1) incorporating biases of semantics behind questions into word embeddings using paragraph2vec like model, modified to take as inputs - words from questions, question title token and question category token, 2) modelling optimum combination of sentences (conclusion and supplement sentences) in the predicted answer, 3) designing abstract scenario for answers, inspired by automated web-service composition framework (Rao & Su (2005)), and 4) extracting important topics in conclusion sentence and emphasizing them in supplemental sentence using attention mechanism (attention mechanism is similar to Tan et al. 2016). 3. The proposed method is shown to outperform the current best method (Tan et al. 2015) by 20% relatively (6% absolutely) which seems to be significant improvement. 4. The paper presents few ablations studies that provide insights on how much different components of the model (such as incorporating biases into word embeddings, incorporating attention from conclusion to supplement) are helping towards performance improvement. Weaknesses/Suggestions/Questions: 1. How are the abstract patterns determined, i,e., how did the authors determine that the answers to love-advice questions generally constitute of sympathy, conclusion, supplement for conclusion and encouragement? How much is the improvement in performance when using abstract patterns compared to the case when not using these patters, i.e. when candidate answers are picked from union of all corpuses rather than picking from respective corpuses (corpuses for sympathy, conclusion etc.). 2. It seems that the abstract patterns are specific to the type of questions. So, the abstract patterns for love-advice will be different from those for business advice. Thus, it seems like the abstract patterns need to be hand-coded for different types and hence one model cannot generalize across different types. 3. The paper should present explicit analysis of how much combinational optimization between sentences help – comparison between model performance with and without combinational optimization keeping rest of the model architecture same. The authors could also plot the accuracy of the model as a function of the combinational optimization scores. This will provide insights into how significant are the combinational optimization scores towards overall model accuracy. 4. Paper says that current systems designed for non-factoid QA cannot generalize to questions outside those stored in QA sites and claims that this is one of the contributions of this paper. In order to ground that claim, the paper should show experimentally how well the proposed method generalized to such out-of-domain questions. Although the questions asked by human experts in the human evaluation were not from the evaluation datasets, the paper should analyze how different those questions were compared to the questions present in the evaluation datasets. 5. For human evaluation, were the outputs of the proposed model and that of the QA-LSTM model judged each judged by both the human experts OR one of the human experts judged the outputs of one system and the other human expert judged the outputs of the other system? If both the sets of outputs were each judged by both the human experts, how were the ratings of the two experts combined for every questions? 6. I wonder why the authors did not do a human evaluation where they just ask human workers (not experts) to compare the output of the proposed model with that of the QA-LSTM model – which of the two outputs they would like to hear when asking for advice. Such an evaluation would not get biased by whether each sentence is good or not, whether the combination is good or not. Looking at the qualitative examples in Table 4, I personally like the output of the QA-LSTM more than that of the proposed model because they seem to provide a direct answer to the question (e.g., for the first example the output of the QA-LSTM says “You should wait until you feel excited”, whereas the output of the proposed model says “It is better to concentrate on how to confess your love to her” which seems a bit indirect to the question asked.) 7. Given a question, is the ground-truth answer different in the two tasks -- answer selection and answer construction? 8. The paper mentions that Attentive LSTM (Tan et al. 2016) is evaluated as the current best answer selection method (section 5.2). So, why is its accuracy lower than that of QA-LSTM in table 1. The authors explain this by pointing out the issue of questions being very long compared to answers and hence the attention being noisy. But, did these issues not exist in the dataset used by Tan et al. 2016? 9. The paper says the proposed method achieves 20% gain over current best (in Conclusion section) where they refer to QA-LSTM as the current best method. However, in the description of Attentive LSTM (section 5.2), the paper mentions that Attention LSTM is the current best method. So, could authors please clarify the discrepancy? 10. Minor correction: remove space between 20 and % in abstract. Review Summary: The problem of non-factoid QA being dealt with in the paper is an interesting and useful problem to solve. The motivations presented in the paper behind the proposed approach are reasonable. The experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline model. However, the use of abstract patterns to determine the answer seems like hand-designing and hence it seems like these abstract patterns need to be designed for every other type of non-factoid question and hence the proposed approach is not generalizable to other types. Also, the paper needs more analysis of the results to provide insights into the contribution of different model components.","The review is largely positive, highlighting the strengths of the paper such as novelty, significant improvement over baseline, and insightful ablation studies.

"This paper presents two models for extractive document summarization: the classifier architecture and the selector architecture. These two models basically use either classification or ranking in a sequential order to pick the candidate sentences for summarization. Experiments in this paper show the results are either better or close to the SOTA. Technical comments: - In equation (1), there is a position-relevant component call *positional importance*. I am wondering how important this component is? Is it possible to show the performance without this component? Especially, for the discussion on impact of document structure, when the model is trained on the shuffled order but tested on the original order. - A similar question about equation (1), is the content-richness component really necessary? Since the score function already has salience part, which could measure how important of with respect to the whole document. - For the dynamic summary representation in equation (3), why not use the same updating equation for both training and test procedures? During test time, the model actually knows the decisions that have been made so far by the decoder. In this way, the model will be more consistent during training and test. - I think section 5 is the most interesting part of this paper, and it is also convincing on the difference between the two architectures. - It is a little disappointing that the decoding algorithm used in this paper is too simple. In a minimal case, both of them could use beam search and the results could be better.","The reviewer provides constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement, indicating a positive attitude towards the paper.

"The paper presents an alternative way of supervising the training of neural network without explicitly using labels when only link/not-link information is available between pairs of examples. A pair of network is trained each of which is used to supervise the other one. The presentation of the paper is not very clear, the writing can be improved. Some design choice are not explained: Why is the power function used in the E-step for approximating the distribution (section 2.1)? Why do the authors only consider a uniform distribution? I understand that using a different prior breaks the assumption that nothing is known about the classes. However I do not see a practical situations where the proposed setting/work would be useful. Also, there exist a large body of work in semi-supervised learning with co-training based on a similar idea. Overall, I think this work should be clarified and improved to be a good fit for this venue.","The reviewer raises several concerns about the paper, including clarity, unexplained design choices, lack of practical applications, and overlap with existing work.

"Description: This paper aims at compressing binary inputs and outputs of neural network models with unsupervised *Bloom embeddings*. The embedding is based on Bloom filters: projecting an element of a set to different positions of a binary array by several independent hash functions, which allows membership checking with no missed but with possibly some false positives. Inputs and outputs are assumed to be sparse. The nonzero elements of an input are then simply encoded by Bloom filters onto the same binary array. The neural network is run with the embedded inputs. Desired outputs are assumed to be a softmax-type ranking of different alternatives. a sort of back-projection step is needed to recover a probability ranking of the desired ground truth alternatives from the lower-dimensional output. For each ground-truth class, this is simply approximated as a product of the output values at the Bloom-filtered hash positions of that class. The paper simply applies this idea, testing it on seven data sets. Scores and training times are compared to the baseline networks without embeddings. Comparison embedding methods are mostly very traditional (hashing trick, error-correcting output codes, linear projection by canonical correlation analysis) but include one recent pairwise mutual information based approach. Evaluation: It is hard to see a lot of novelty in this paper. The Bloom filters are an existing technique, which is applied very straightforwardly here. The back-projection step of equation 2 is also a straightforward continuous-valued variant of the Bloom-filter membership test. The way of recovering outputs is heuristic, since the neural network inbetween the embedded inputs and outputs is not really aware that the outputs will be run through a further back-projection step. In the comparisons of Table 3, only two embedding dimensionalities are used for each data set. This is insufficient, since it leaves open the question whether other methods could get improved performance for higher/lower embeddings, relative to the proposed method. (In appendix B, Figure 4, authors do compare their method to a variant of it for many different embedding dimensionalities; why not do this for all comparison methods too?) Overall, this seems for the most part too close to off-the-shelf existing embedding to be acceptable. Minor points: As the paper notes, dimensionality reduction of inputs by various techniques is common. The paper lists some simple embeddings such as SVD based ones, CCA etc. but a more thorough review of other approaches including the vast array of nonlinear dimensionality reduction solutions should be mentioned. The experiments in the paper seem to have an underlying assumption that inputs and outputs need to have the same type of embedding dimension. This seems unnecessary.","The review is critical of the paper's novelty and technical depth. The reviewer finds the application of Bloom filters straightforward and the output recovery method heuristic. The reviewer also points out limitations in the experimental evaluation, such as the limited exploration of embedding dimensionalities. The tone, while critical, maintains a professional and analytical approach without resorting to personal attacks or disrespectful language.",-50,50
"Apologies for the late review. This submission proposes method for class-conditional generative image modeling using auxiliary classifiers. Compared to normal GANs the generator also receives a randomly sampled class label c from the class distribution. The discriminator has two outputs and two corresponding objectives: determine whether a sample is real or generated, and independently to predict the (real or sampled) class label corresponding to the sample. Figure 2. nicely illustrates related methods - this particular method bears similarities to InfoGANs and Semi-supervised GANs. Compared to infogans, this method also encourages correspondence between the latent c and the real class labels for the real examples (whereas infogans are presented as fully unsupervised). The authors attempt at evaluating the method quantitatively by looking at the discriminability and diversity of samples. It is found - not surprisingly - that higher resolution improves discriminability (because more information is present). Discriminability: Figure 3 doesn’t have legends so it is a bit hard to understand what is going on. Furthermore, my understanding is that when evaluating discriminability the authors downsample and then bicubically upsample the image, which is much more like a blurring, very different from retraining all the models to work on low resolution in the first place. Diversity: The authors try to quantitatively evaluate diversity of samples by measuring the average MS-SSIM between randomly selected pairs of points within each class. I think this method is significantly flawed and limited, for reasons mentioned in (Theis et al, 2015, A note on the evaluation…). In its behaviour, MS-SSIM is not that dissimilar from Euclidean distance - although it is nonlinear and is bounded between -1 and 1. Evaluating diversity/entropy of samples in high dimensions is very hard, especially if the distributions involved are non-trivial for example concentrated around manifolds. Consider for example a generative model which randomly samples just two images. Assuming that the MSSSIM between these two images is -1, this generative model can easily achieve an average MSSSIM score of 0, implying a conclusion that this model has more diversity than the training data itself. Conversely, SSIM is designed not to be sensitive to contrast and average pixel intensity, so if a model is diverse in this sense, that will be ignored by this measure. Overall, the paper proposes a new way to incorporate class labels into training GAN-type models. As far as I know the particular algorithm is novel, but I consider it incremental compared to what has been done before. I think the proposed evaluation metrics are flawed, especially when evaluating the diversity of the samples for the aforementioned reasons.","The reviewer acknowledges the novelty of the proposed method but seems to find it ""incremental"" rather than groundbreaking. They find significant flaws in the evaluation metrics proposed, particularly regarding diversity measurement. The language is critical of the work but remains professional and not directly insulting.",-10,60
"The authors proposes an interesting idea of connecting the energy-based model (descriptor) and the generator network to help each other. The samples from the generator are used as the initialization of the descriptor inference. And the revised samples from the descriptor is in turn used to update the generator as the target image. The proposed idea is interesting. However, I think the main flaw is that the advantages of having that architecture are not convincingly demonstrated in the experiments. For example, readers will expect quantative analysis on how initializing with the samples from the generator helps? Also, the only quantative experiment on the reconstruction is also compared to quite old models. Considering that the model is quite close to the model of Kim & Bengio 2016, readers would also expect a comparison to that model. ** Minor - I*m wondering if the analysis on the convergence is sound when considering the fact that samples from SGLD are biased samples (with fixed step size). - Can you explain a bit more on how you get Eqn 8? when p(x|y) is also dependent on W_G?","The review starts with positive wording, acknowledging the interesting idea.

"This paper explores the use of Open Bigrams as a target representation of words, for application to handwriting image recognition. Pros: - The use of OBs is novel and interesting. - Clearly written and explained. Cons: - No comparison to previous state of the art, only with author-generated results. - More ablation studies needed -- i.e. fill in Table3 with rnn0,1 rnn0,1,2 rnn0,1* etc etc. It is not clear where the performance is coming from, as it seems that it is single character modelling (0) and word endings (*) that are actually beneficial. - While the use of Open bigrams is novel, there are works which use bag of bigrams and ngrams as models which are not really compared to or explored. E.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2227 [1] and https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5903 [2]. Both use bag of ngrams models and achieve state of the art results, so it would be interesting to see whether open bigrams in the same experimental setup as [1] would yield better results. - Why not use a graph-based decoder like in Fig 2 b?

"The paper tackles the task of music generation. They use an orderless NADE model for the task of *fill in the notes*. Given a roll of T timesteps of pitches, they randomly mask out some pitches, and the model is trained to predict the missing notes. This follows how the orderless NADE model can be trained. During sampling, one normally follows an ancestral sampling procedure. For this, an ordering is defined over outputs, and one runs the model on the current input, samples one of the outputs according to the order, adds this output to the next input, and continues this procedure until all outputs have been sampled. The key point of the paper is that this is a bad sampling strategy. Instead, they suggest the strategy of Yao et al. 2014, which uses a blocked Gibbs sampling approach. The blocked Gibbs strategy instead masks N inputs randomly and independently, samples them, and repeats this procedure. The point of this strategy is the make sure the sampling chain mixes well, which will happen for large N. However, since the samples are independent, having a large N gives incoherent samples. Thus, the authors follow an annealed schedule for N, making it smaller over time, which will eventually reduce to ancestral sampling (giving global structure to the sample). They conduct a variety of experiments involving both normal metrics and human evaluations, and find that this blocked Gibbs sampling outperforms other sampling procedures. This is a well written paper - great job. My main problem with the paper is that having read Uria and Yao, I don*t know how much I have learned from this work in the context of this being an ICLR submission. If this was submitted to some computational music / art conference, this paper would be a clear accept. However, for ICLR, I don*t see enough novelty compared with previous works this builds upon. Orderless NADE is an established model. The blocked Gibbs sampling and annealing scheme are basically the exact same one used in Yao. Thus, the main novelty of this paper is its application to the music domain, and finding that Yao*s method works better for sampling music. This is a good contribution, but more tailored to those working in the music domain. If the authors found that these results also hold for other domains like images (e.g. on CIFAR / tiny Imagenet) and text (e.g. document generation), then I would change my mind and accept this paper for ICLR. Even just trying musical domains other than Bach chorales would be useful. However, as it stands, the experiments are not convincing enough.","The reviewer acknowledges the paper is well-written and the research makes a good contribution to the music domain.

"The paper proposes a new neural architecture, called DRAGNN, for the transition-based framework. A DRAGNN uses TBRUs which are neural units to compute hidden activations for the current state of a transition-based system. The paper proves that DRAGNNs can cover a wide range of transition-based methods in the literature. In addition, one can easily implement multitask learning systems with DRAGNNs. The experimental results shows that using DRAGNNs the authors built (near) state-of-the-art systems for 2 tasks: parsing and summarization. The paper contains two major parts: DRAGNN and demonstrations of its usages. Regarding to the first part, the proposed DRAGNN is a neat tool for building any transition-based systems. However, it is difficult to say whether the DRAGNN is novel. Transition-based framework is already well defined and there*s a huge trend in NLP using neural networks to implement transition-based systems. In my opinion, the difference between the Stack-LSTM (Dyer et al., 2015) and DRAGNN is slight. Of course, the DRAGNN is a powerful architecture but the contribution here should be considered mainly in terms of software engineering. In the second part, the authors used DRAGNN to implement new transition-based systems for different (multi-)tasks. The implementations are neat, confirming that DRAGNN is a powerful architecture, especially for multitask learning. However, we should bear in mind that the solutions employed are already there in the literature, thus making difficult to judge the novelty of this part w.r.t. the theme of the conference.","The review starts with positive statements, highlighting the advantages and neatness of DRAGNN.

"The paper formulates a number of rules for designing convolutional neural network architectures for image processing and computer vision problems. Essentially, it reads like a review paper about modern CNN architectures. It also proposes a few new architectural ideas inspired by these rules. These are experimentally evaluated on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, but seem to achieve relatively poor performance on these datasets (Table 1), so their merit is unclear to me. I*m not sure if such a collection of rules extracted from prior work warrants publication as a research paper. It is not a bad idea to try and summarise some of these observations now that CNNs have been the model of choice for computer vision tasks for a few years, and such a summary could be useful for newcomers. However, a lot of it seems to boil down to common sense (e.g. #1, #3, #7, #11). The rest of it might be more suited for an *introduction to training CNNs* course / blog post. It also seems to be a bit skewed towards recent work that was fairly incremental (e.g. a lot of attention is given to the flurry of ResNet variants). The paper states that *it is universal in all convolutional neural networks that the activations are downsampled and the number of channels increased from the input to the final layer*, which is wrong. We already discussed this previously re: my question about design pattern 5, but I think the answer that was given (*the nature of design patterns is that they only apply some of the time*) does not excuse making such sweeping claims. This should probably be removed. *We feel that normalization puts all the layer*s input samples on more equal footing, which allows backprop to train more effectively* (section 3.2, 2nd paragraph) is very vague language that has many possible interpretations and should probably be clarified. It also seems odd to start this sentence with *we feel*, as this doesn*t seem like the kind of thing one should have an opinion about. Such claims should be corroborated by experiments and measurements. There are several other instances of this issue across the paper. The connection between Taylor series and the proposed Taylor Series Networks seems very tenuous and I don*t think the name is appropriate. The resulting function is not even a polynomial as all the terms represent different functions -- f(x) + g(x)**2 + h(x)**3 + ... is not a particularly interesting object, it is just a nonlinear function of x.

"The paper proposes a greedy supervised layer-wise initialization strategy for (deep) multi-layer perceptrons. Layer weights are initialized by training linear SVMs for binary classification where the binary targets are constructed as error correcting codes (ECOC, including one-vs-all, one-vs-one and others). The thus pertained model (together with a softmax output layer) is then globally fine-tuned by backdrop with dropout. Note that as a heuristic greedy supervised layer-wise initialization strategy this work is very similar to the author’s other ICLR submission: « Marginal Deep Architectures: Deep learning for Small and Middle Scale Applications ». The two works differ in the supervised initialization strategy employed. While layer-wise initialization strategies are worthy of further exploration, the paper doesn’t convey any insight as to what makes a better strategy. Experimental results are not sufficiently convincing by themselves alone to support a mostly incremental work; in particular I remain unconvinced that competing methods received full proper hyper-parameter tuning of their own. Results showing accuracies as bar graphs make it hard to read-off precise accuracies, and one cannot easily compare with known state-of-the-art performance references on benchmark problems (such as MNIST). CIFAR10 performance seem far from state-of-the-art. Explanations are unnecessarily detailed for standard algorithms (e.g. SVMs) and not sufficiently for aspects specific to the approach such as lesser known ECOC schemes. One important aspect remains unclear regarding the use of SVMs. Did you use linear SVMs as stated in section 3.1 (« In order to take the probabilistic outputs of the base classifiers as new representations of data, we adopt linear support vector machines (linear SVMs) as the binary classifiers ») or kernel SVMs as mentioned later « For all DeepECOC models, we used support vector machines (SVMs) with RBF kernel function». In the latter case, the paper lacks a description of how learned RBF-kernel SVMs are transferred to a deep network layer (does it yield 2 layers the firrst of which would be a large RBF neural layer?) Also in this case of kernel SVMs the computational cost is likely to skyrocket and the method will have scaling issues. Is this the reason why the method is too expensive to use on CIFAR10 from scratch, and prompts doing LBP first? If you used linear SVMs, did you use an efficient implementation specific to linear SVMS (as opposed to generic kernel SVM code with a linear kernel?). Finally for image datasets, a visual comparison of learned filters could help provide some qualitative insight.","The review is critical of the paper, pointing out several weaknesses and flaws.

"This submission proposes an approach to adapting the variational auto-encoder framework (VAE) to the clustering scenario. First the model has to be adapted (with a Gaussian mixture as a prior) and then the inference has to become consistent (by introducing a regularization term). A general positive point about this paper is that the model construction is kept simple. Indeed, the assumption about the mixture prior is simple but reasonable, and the inference follows the VAE framework where appropriate with only changing parts that do not conform with the clustering task. These changes are also motivated by some analysis. The presentation is also kept simple: the linking to VAE and related methods is made in an clear and honest way, so that it*s easy to follow the paper and understand how everything fits together. Also, the regularization term is a well motivated and reasonable addition. Given the VAE context in this paper, I*d be interested in seeing a discussion on the variance of the samples in (6). A negative issue of this paper is that all crucial regularizations rely upon ad-hoc parameters that control their strength, namely eta (eq. (3)) and alpha (eq. 7). According to the authors adjusting these parameters is crucial, and there seems to be no principled way of adjusting them. It also seems that these two parameters interact, since they both regularize z in different ways. This makes the search space over them grow multiplicatively, since the tuning problem now becomes combinatorial. The authors mention that they tune the trade-off between these two regularizers, but I*d be interested in a comment concerning how this is done (what*s the space of parameters to search on). In practical clustering applications, high sensitivity to tuned parameters is undesirable, since one also needs to cross-validate values of K at the same time. I really liked the experiments section. It is not very exhaustive in terms of comparison, but it is very exploratory in terms of demonstrating the model components, strengths and weaknesses. This is much more useful than reporting unintuitive percentage improvements relative to arbitrarily selected baselines and datasets. Overall, I am a little concerned about the practicality of this approach, given the tuning it requires. However, I am in favor of accepting this paper because it makes its strong and weak points very clear through good explanation and demonstration. Therefore, I expect further research to be built on top of this paper, so that the aforementioned issues will hopefully be alleviated in the future. Finally, the theoretical intuitions given in the paper (and author comments) improve its usefulness as a scientific manuscript.","The reviewer highlights both positive and negative aspects of the paper. They praise the simplicity and clarity of the model and presentation, as well as the well-executed experiments. However, they express concern about the reliance on ad-hoc parameters and the lack of a principled approach to tuning them.

"This paper considers the case where multiple views of data are learned through a probabilistic deep neural network formulation. This makes the model non-linear (unlike e.g. CCA) but makes inference difficult. Therefore, the VAE framework is invoked for inference. In [Ref 1] the authors show that maximum likelihood estimation based on their linear latent model leads to the canonical correlation directions. But in the non-linear case with DNNs it*s not clear (at least with the present analysis) what the solution is wrt to the canonical directions. There*s no such analysis in the paper, hence I find it a stretch to refer to this model as a CCA type of model. In contrast, e.g. DCCA / DCCAE are taking the canonical correlation between features into account inside the objective and provide interpretations. [Ref 1] F. R. Bach and M. I. Jordan. A probabilistic interpretation of canonical correlation analysis. Technical Report 688, 2005. There is also a significant body of very related work on non-linear multi-view models which is not discussed in this paper. For example, there*s been probabilistic non-linear multi-view models [Ref 2, 3], also extended to the Bayesian case with common/private spaces [Ref 4] and the variational / deep learning case [Ref 5]. [Ref 2] Ek et al. Gaussian process latent variable models for human pose estimation. MLMI, 2007. [Ref 3] Shon et al. Learning shared latent structure for image synthesis and robotic imitation. NIPS, 2006. [Ref 4] Damianou et al. Manifold relevance determination. ICML, 2012. [Ref 5] Damianou and Lawrence. Deep Gaussian processes. AISTATS, 2013. I can see the utility of this model as bringing together two elements: multi-view modeling and VAEs. This seems like an obvious idea but to the best of my knowledge it hasn*t been done before and is actually a potentially very useful model. However, the question is, what is the proper way of extending VAE to multiple views? The paper didn*t convince me that VAE can work well with multiple views using the shown straightforward construction. Specifically, VCCA doesn*t seem to promote the state of the art in terms of results (it actually is overall below the SOA), while the VCCA-private seems a quite ill-posed model: the dimensionalities d have to be manually tuned with exhaustive search; further, the actual model does not provide a consinstent way of encouraging the private and common variables to avoid learning redundant information. Relying only on dropout for this seems a quite ad-hoc solution (in fact, from Fig. 4 (ver2) it seems that the dropout rate is quite crucial). Perhaps good performance might be achieved with a lot of tuning (which might be why the FLICKR results got better in ver2 without changing the model), but it seems quite difficult to optimize for the above reasons. From a purely experimental point of view, VCCA-private doesn*t seem to promote the SOA either. Of course one wouldn*t expect any new published paper to beat all previous baselines, but it seems that extension of VAE to multiple views is a very interesting idea which deserves some more investigation of how to do it efficiently. Another issue is the approximate posterior being parameterized only from one of the views. This makes the model less useful as a generic multi-view model, since it will misbehave in tasks other than classification. But if classification is the main objective, then one should compare to a proper classification model, e.g. a feedforward neural network. The plots of Fig. 8 are very nice. Overall, the paper convinced me that there is merit in attaching multiple views to VAE. However, it didn*t convince me a) that the proposed way to achieve this is practical b) that there is a connection to CCA (other than being a method for multiple views). The bottom line is that, although the paper is interesting, it needs a little more work.","The reviewer acknowledges the merit of the paper's idea and its potential usefulness. However, they express several concerns, particularly regarding the model's effectiveness, connection to CCA, and experimental validation. The reviewer finds the straightforward extension of VAE to multiple views unconvincing and points out limitations in performance and optimization. While the reviewer acknowledges the paper's interesting aspects, they ultimately believe it requires further development.

"This paper proposes an unsupervised training objective based on patch contrasting for visual representation learning using deep neural networks. In particular, the feature representations of the patches from the same image are encouraged to be closer than the those from different images. The distance ratios of positive training pairs are optimized. The proposed method are empirically shown to be effective as an initialization method for supervised training. Strengths: - The training objective is reasonable. In particular, high-level features show translation invariance. - The proposed methods are effective for initializing neural networks for supervised training on several datasets. Weaknesses: - The methods are technically similar to the “exemplar network” (Dosovitskiy 2015). Cropping patches from a single image can be taken as a type of data augmentation, which is comparable to the data augmentation of positive sample (the exemplar) in (Dosovitskiy 2015). - The paper is experimentally misleading. The results reported in this paper are based on fine-tuning the whole network with supervision. However, in Table 2, the results of exemplar convnets (Dosovitskiy 2015) is from unsupervised feature learning (the network is not finetuned with labeled samples, and only a classifier is trained upon the features). Therefore, the comparison is not fair. I suspect that exemplar convnets (Dosovitskiy 2015) would achieve similar improvements from fine-tuning; so, without such comparisons (head-to-head comparison with and without fine-tuning based on the same architecture except for the loss), the experimental results are not fully convincing. Regarding the comparison to “What-where” autoencoder (Zhao et al, 2015), it will be interesting to compare against it in large-scale settings, as shown by Zhang et al, ICML 2016 (Augmenting Supervised Neural Networks with Unsupervised Objectives for Large-Scale Image Classification). Training an AlexNet is not very time-consuming with latest (e.g., TITAN-X level) GPUs. The proposed method seems useful only for natural images where different patches from the same image can be similar to each other.","The reviewer acknowledges the strengths of the paper, such as the reasonable training objective and effectiveness of the proposed method.

The paper addresses an important problem - namely on how to improve diversity in responses. It is applaudable that the authors show results on several tasks showing the applicability across different problems. In my view there are two weaknesses at this point 1) the improvements (for essentially all tasks) seem rather minor and do not really fit the overall claim of the paper 2) the approach seems quite ad hoc and it unclear to me if this is something that will and should be widely adopted. Having said this the gist of the proposed solution seems interesting but somewhat premature.,"The reviewer acknowledges the importance of the topic and applauds the authors for tackling it and providing results across different tasks.

"I was holding off on this review hoping to get the missing details from the code at https://github.com/alexnowakvilla/DP, but at this time it*s still missing. After going over this paper couple of times I*m still missing the details necessary to reproduce the experiments. I think this would be a common problem for readers of this paper, so the paper needs to be improved, perhaps with a toy example going through all the stages of learning. As an example of the difficulty, take section 4.3. It talks about training *split block* which is a function that can assign each element to either partition 0 or partition 1. At this point I*m looking at it as a binary classification problem and looking for the parameters, loss, and how this loss is minimized. Instead I get a lot of unexpected information, such as *we must create artificial targets at every node of the generated tree from the available final target partition*. What are these artificial targets, and how do they relate to the problem of training the splitter?

"Dyvedeep presents three approximation techniques for deep vision models aimed at improving inference speed. The techniques are novel as far as I know. The paper is clear, the results are plausible. The evaluation of the proposed techniques is does not make a compelling case that someone interested in faster inference would ultimately be well-served by a solution involving the proposed methods. The authors delineate *static* acceleration techniques (e.g. reduced bit-width, weight pruning) from *dynamic* acceleration techniques which are changes to the inference algorithm itself. The delineation would be fine if the use of each family of techniques were independent of the other, but this is not the case. For example, the use of SPET would, I think, conflict with the use of factored weight matrices (I recall this from http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5025-predicting-parameters-in-deep-learning.pdf, but I suspect there may be more recent work). For this reason, a comparison between SPET and factored weight matrices would strengthen the case that SPET is a relevant innovation. In favor of the factored-matrix approach, there would I think be fewer hyperparameters and the computations would make more-efficient use of blocked linear algebra routines--the case for the superiority of SPET might be difficult to make. The authors also do not address their choice of the Xeon for benchmarking, when the use cases they identify in the introduction include *low power* and *deeply embedded* applications. In these sorts of applications, a mobile GPU would be used, not a Xeon. A GPU implementation of a convnet works differently than a CPU implementation in ways that might reduce or eliminate the advantage of the acceleration techniques put forward in this paper.","The review starts with positive statements, highlighting novelty, clarity, and plausibility of the work.

"Paper summary: this work presents ENet, a new convnet architecture for semantic labeling which obtains comparable performance to the previously existing SegNet while being ~10x faster and using ~10x less memory. Review summary: Albeit the results seem interesting, the paper lacks detailed experimental results, and is of limited interest for the ICLR audience. Pros: * 10x faster * 10x smaller * Design rationale described in detail Cons: * The quality of the reference baseline is low. For instance, cityscapes results are 58.3 IoU while state of the art is ~80 IoU. Thus the results are of limited interest. * The results that support the design rationale are not provided. It is important to provide the experimental evidence to support each claim. Quality: the work is interesting but feels incomplete. If your model is 10x faster and smaller, why not try build a model 10x longer to obtain improved results ? The paper focuses only on nimbleness at the cost of quality (using a weak baseline). This limits the interest for the ICLR audience. Clarity: the overall text is somewhat clear, but the model description (section 3) could be more clear. Originality: the work is a compendium of “practitioners wisdom” applied to a specific task. It has thus limited originality. Significance: I find the work that establishes a new “best practices all in one” quite interesting, but however these must shine in all aspects. Being fast at the cost of quality, will limit the impact of this work. Minor comments: * Overall the text is proper english but the sentences constructions is often unsound, specific examples below. * To improve the chances of acceptance, I invite the authors to also explore bigger models and show that the same “collected wisdom” can be used both to reach high speed and high quality (with the proper trade-off curve being shown). Aiming for only one end of the quality versus speed curve limits too much the paper. * Section 1: “mobile or battery powered … require rates > 10 fps“. 10 fps with which energy budget ?

Make explicit or remove * “Real-time” is vague, you mean X fps @ Y W ? * Other existing architectures -> Other architectures * Section 3, does not the BN layer include a bias term ? Can you get good results without any bias term ? * Table 1: why is the initial layer a downsampling one, since the results has half the size of the input ? * Section 4, non linear operations. What do you mean by “settle to recurring pattern” ? * Section 4, dimensionality changes. “Computationally expensive”, relative to what ? * Section 4, dimensionality changes. “This technique ... speeds-up ten times”, but does not provide the same results. Without an experimental validation changing an apple for an orange does not make the orange better than the apple. * Section 4, dimensionality changes. “Found one problem”, problem would imply something conceptually wrong. This is more an “issue” or an “miss-match” when using ResNet for semantic labelling. * Section 4, factorizing filters. I am unsure of why you call nx1 filter asymmetric. A filter could be 1xn yet be symmetric (e.g. -2 -1 0 1 2). Why not simply call them rectangular filters ? * Section 4, factorizing filters. Why would this change increase the variety ? I would have expected the opposite. * Section 4, regularization. Define “much better”. * Section 5.1; “640x360 is adequate for practical applications”; for _some_ applications. * Section 5.2, “very quickly” is vague and depends on the reader expectations, please be quantitative. * Section 5.2, Haver -> have * Section 5.2, in this work -> In this work * Section 5.2, unclear what you use the class weighting for. Is this for class balancing ? * Section 5.2, Cityscapes was -> Cityscapes is * Section 5.2, weighted by the average -> is each instance weighted relative the average object size. * Section 5.2, fastest model in the Cityscapes -> fastest model in the public Cityscapes","The review acknowledges the interesting aspects of the work, such as speed and size improvements.

Instead, it suggests LP *cannot* be faster than these methods by 2x and log p times. More specifically, Eq (2) shows T_broadcase_BE/ T_broadcase_LP < 2. This does not provide an upper-bound of T_broadcase_LP and it can be arbitrary worse when comparing with T_broadcase_BE from this inequality.

"Summary: This paper proposes a read-again attention-based representation of the document with the copy mechanism for the summarization task. The model reads each sentence in the input document twice and creates a hierarchical representation of it instead of a bidirectional RNN. During the decoding, it uses the representation of the document obtained via the read-again mechanism and points the words that are OOV in the source document. The model does abstractive summarization. The authors show improvements on DUC 2004 dataset and provide an analysis of their model with different configurations. Contributions: The main contribution of this paper is the read-again attention mechanism where the model reads the same sentence twice and obtains a better representation of the document. Writing: The text of this paper needs more work. There are several typos and the explanations of the model/architecture are not really clear, some parts of the paper feel somewhat bloated. Pros: - The proposed model is a simple extension to the model to the model proposed in [2] for summarization. - The results are better than the baselines. Cons: - The improvements are not that large. - Justifications are not strong enough. - The paper needs a better writeup. Several parts of the text are not using a clear/precise language and the paper needs a better reorganization. Some parts of the text is somewhat informal. - The paper is very application oriented. Question: - How does the training speed when compared to the regular LSTM? Some Criticisms: A similar approach to the read again mechanism which is proposed in this paper has already been explored in [1] in the context of algorithmic learning and I wouldn’t consider the application of that on the summarization task a significant contribution. The justification behind the read-again mechanism proposed in this paper is very weak. It is not really clear why additional gating alpha_i is needed for the read again stage. As authors also suggest, pointer mechanism for the unknown/rare words [2] and it is adopted for the read-again attention mechanism. However, in the paper, it is not clear where the real is the gain coming from, whether from “read-again” mechanism or the use of “pointing”. The paper is very application focused, the contributions of the paper in terms of ML point of view is very weak. It is possible to try this read-again mechanism on more tasks other than summarization, such as NMT, in order to see whether if those improvements are The writing of this paper needs more work. In general, it is not very well-written.

"This paper attempted to solve an interesting problem -- incorporating hard constraints in seq2seq model. The main idea is to modify the weight of the neural network in order to find a feasible solution. Overall, the idea presented in the paper is interesting, and it tries to solve an important problem.

Therefore, I*m not convinced that the proposed approach is a right direction for solving this problem (In table, 1, the authors mention that they run 100 steps of SGD). - If I understand correctly, Eq (7) is a noncontinuous function w.r.t W_lambda and the simple SGD algorithm will not be able to find its minimum. - For dependency parsing, there are standard splits of PTB. I would suggest the authors follow the same splits of train, dev, and test in order to compare with existing results. Minor comments: several sentences are misleading and should be rewritten carefully. - Beginning of Section 3: *A major advantage of neural network is that once trained, inference is extremely efficient.* This sentence is not generally right, and I guess the authors mean if using greedy search as inference method, the inference is efficient. - The description in the end of section 2 is awkward. To me, feed-forward and RNN are general families that cover many specific types of neural networks, and the training procedures are not necessarily to aim to optimize Eq. (2). Therefore, the description here might not be true. In fact, I don*t think there is a need to bring up feed-forward networks here; instead, the authors should provide more details the connection between RNN and Eq (2) here. - The second paragraph of section 3 is related to [1], where it shows the search space of the inference can be represented as an imperative program.

"This paper proposes the Layerwise Origin Target Synthesis (LOTS) method, which entails computing a difference in representation at a given layer in a neural network and then projecting that difference back to input space using backprop. Two types of differences are explored: linear scalings of a single input’s representation and difference vectors between representations of two inputs, where the inputs are of different classes. In the former case, the LOTS method is used as a visualization of the representation of a specific input example, showing what it would mean, in input space, for the feature representation to be supressed or magnified. While it’s an interesting computation to perform, the value of the visualizations is not very clear. In the latter case, LOTS is used to generate adversarial examples, moving from an origin image just far enough toward a target image to cause the classification to flip. As expected, the changes required are smaller when LOTS targets a higher layer (in the limit of targetting the last layer, results similar to the original adversarial image results would be obtained). The paper is an interesting basic exploration and would probably be a great workshop paper. However, the results are probably not quite compelling enough to warrant a full ICLR paper. A few suggestions for improvement: - Several times it is claimed that LOTS can be used as a method for mining for diverse adversarial examples that could be used in training classifiers more robust to adversarial perturbation. But this simple experiment of training on LOTS generated examples isn’t tried. Showing whether the LOTS method outperforms, say, FGS would go a long way toward making a strong paper. - How many layers are in the networks used in the paper, and what is their internal structure? This isn’t stated anywhere. I was left wondering whether, say, in Fig 2 the CONV2_1 layer was immediately after the CONV1_1 layer and whether the FC8 layer was the last layer in the network. - In Fig 1, 2, 3, and 4, results of the application of LOTS are shown for many intermediate layers but miss for some reason applying it to the input (data) layer and the output/classification (softmax) layer. Showing the full range of possible results would reinforce the interpreatation (for example, in Fig 3, are even larger perturbations necessary in pixel space vs CONV1 space? And does operating directly in softmax space result in smaller perturbations than IP2?) - The PASS score is mentioned a couple times but never explained at all. E.g. Fig 1 makes use of it but does not specify such basics as whether higher or lower PASS scores are associated with more or less severe perturbations. A basic explanation would be great. - 4.2 states “In summary, the visualized internal feature representations of the origin suggest that lower convolutional layers of the VGG Face model have managed to learn and capture features that provide semantically meaningful and interpretable representations to human observers.” I don’t see that this follows from any results. If this is an important claim to the paper, it should be backed up by additional arguments or results. 1/19/17 UPDATE AFTER REBUTTAL: Given that experiments were added to the latest version of the paper, I*m increasing my review from 5 -> 6.

"Overall the paper has the feel of a status update by some of the best researchers in the field. The paper is very clear, the observations are interesting, but the remarks are scattered and don*t add up to a quantum of progress in the study of what can be done with the Neural GPU model. Minor remark on the use of the term RNN in Table 1: I found Table 1 confusing because several of the columns are for models that are technically RNNs, and use of RNNs for e.g. translation and word2vec highlight that RNNs can be characterized in terms of the length of their input sequence, the length of their input, and the sizes (per step) of their input, output, and working memories. Basic model question: How are inputs presented (each character 1-hot?) and outputs retrieved when there are e.g. 512 “filters” in the model ? If inputs and outputs are 1-hot encoded, and treated with the same filters as intermediate layers, then the intermediate activation functions should be interpretable as digits, and we should be able to interpret the filters as implementing a reliable e.g. multiplication-with-carry algorithm. Looking at the intermediate values may shed some light on why the usually-working models fail on e.g. the pathological cases identified in Table 3. The preliminary experiment on input alignment is interesting in two ways: the seeds for effective use of an attentional mechanism are there, but also, it suggests that the model is not presently dealing with general expression evaluation the way a correct algorithm should. The remarks in the abstract about improving the memory efficiency of Neural GPU seem overblown -- the paragraph at the top of page 6 describes the improvements as using tf.while_loop instead of unrolling the graph, and using swap_memory to use host memory when GPU memory runs short. These both seem like good practice, but not a remarkable improvement to the efficiency of the model, in fact it would likely slow down training and inference when memory does in fact fit in the GPU. The point about trying many of random seeds to get convergence makes me wonder if the Neural GPU is worth its computational cost at all, when evaluated as means of learning algorithms that are already well understood (e.g. parsing and evaluating S-exprs). Consider spending all of the computational cycles that go into training one of these models (with the multiple seeds) on a traditional search through program space (e.g. sampling lisp programs or something). The notes on the curriculum strategies employed to get the presented results were interesting to read, as an indication of the lengths to which someone might have to go to train this sort of model, but it does leave this reviewer with the impression that despite the stated extensions of the Neural GPU model it remains unclear how useful it might be to practical problems.","The review is predominantly negative due to several factors: skepticism about the significance of the research (""don't add up to a quantum of progress""), questioning the model's efficiency and practicality, and suggesting alternative approaches.

"This paper presents a meta-learning algorithm which learns to learn generative models from a small set of examples. It’s similar in structure to the matching networks of Vinyals et al. (2016), and is trained in a meta-learning framework where the inputs correspond to datasets. Results are shown on Omniglot in terms of log-likelihoods and in terms of generated samples. The proposed idea seems reasonable, but I’m struggling to understand various aspects of the paper. The exposition is hard to follow, partly because existing methods are described using terminology fairly different from that of the original authors. Most importantly, I can’t tell which aspects are meant to be novel, since there are only a few sentences devoted to matching networks, even though this work builds closely upon them. (I brought this up in my Reviewer Question, and the paper has not been revised to make this clearer.) I’m also confused about the meta-learning setup. One natural formulation for meta-learning of generative models would be that the inputs consist of small datasets X, and the task is to predict the distribution from which X was sampled. But this would imply a uniform weighting of data points, which is different from the proposed method. Based on 3.1, it seems like one additionally has some sort of query q, but it’s not clear what this represents. In terms of experimental validation, there aren’t any comparisons against prior work. This seems necessary, since several other methods have already been proposed which are similar in spirit.","The reviewer expresses confusion and struggles to understand key aspects of the paper, such as novelty and the meta-learning setup.

"The paper presents a few tricks to compress a wide and shallow text classification model based on n-gram features. These tricks include (1) using (optimized) product quantization to compress embedding weights (2) pruning some of the vocabulary elements (3) hashing to reduce the storage of the vocabulary (this is a minor component of the paper). The paper focuses on models with very large vocabularies and shows a reduction in the size of the models at a relatively minor reduction of the accuracy. The problem of compressing neural models is important and interesting. The methods section of the paper is well written with good high level comments and references. However, the machine learning contributions of the paper are marginal to me. The experiments are not too convincing mainly focusing on benchmarks that are not commonly used. The implications of the paper on the state-of-the-art RNN text classification models is unclear. The use of (optimized) product quantization for approximating inner product is not particularly novel. Previous work also considered doing this. Most of the reduction in the model sizes comes from pruning vocabulary elements. The method proposed for pruning vocabulary elements is simply based on the assumption that embeddings with larger L2 norm are more important. A coverage heuristic is taken into account too. From a machine learning point of view, the proper baseline to solve this problem is to have a set of (relaxed) binary coefficients for each embedding vector and learn the coefficients jointly with the weights. An L1 regularizer on the coefficients can be used to encourage sparsity. From a practical point of view, I believe an important baseline is missing: what if one simply uses fewer vocabulary elements (e.g based on subword units - see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.07909.pdf) and retrain a smaller models? Given the lack of novelty and the missing baselines, I believe the paper in its current form is not ready for publication at ICLR. More comments: - The title does not make it clear that the paper focuses on wide and shallow text classification models. Please revise the title. - The paper cites an ArXiv manuscript by Carreira-Perpinan and Alizadeh (2016) several times, which has the same title as the submitted paper.

"This paper proposes a method for estimating the context sensitivity of paraphrases and uses that to inform a word embedding learning model. The main idea and model are presented convincingly and seem plausible. The main weaknesses of the paper are shortcomings in the experimental evaluation and in the model exploration. The evaluation does not convincingly determine whether the model is a significant improvement over simpler methods (particularly those that do not require the paraphrase database!). Likewise, the model section did not convince me that this was the most obvious model formulation to try. The paper would be stronger if model choices were explained more convincingly or - better yet - alternatives were explored. On balance I lean towards rejecting the paper and encouraging the authors to submit a revised and improved version at a near point in the future. Detailed/minor points below: 1) While the paper is grammatically mostly correct, it would benefit from revision with the help of a native English speaker. In its current form long sections are very difficult to understand due to the unconventional sentence structure. 2) The tables need better and more descriptive labels. 3) The results are somewhat inconclusive. Particularly in the analogy task in Table 4 it is surprising that CBOW does better on the semantic aspect of the task than your embeddings which are specifically tailored to be good at this? 4) Why was *Enriched CBOW* not included in the analogy task? 5) In the related work section several papers are mentioned that learn embeddings from a combination of lexica and corpora, yet it is repeatedly said that this was the first work of such a kind / that there hasn*t been enough work on this.

"This paper addresses the problem of data sparsity in the healthcare domain by leveraging hierarchies of medical concepts organized in ontologies. The paper focuses on sequential prediction given a patient’s medical record (a sequence of medical codes, some of which might occur very rarely). Instead of simply assigning each medical code an independent embedding before feeding it to an RNN, the proposed approach assigns each node in the medical ontology a “basic” embedding, and composes a “final” embedding for each medical code by taking a learned weighted average (via an attention mechanism) of the medical code’s ancestors in the ontology. Notably, the paper is well written and the approach is quite intuitive. I have the following comments: - Why is the patient’s visit taken as just the sum of medical codes found in the visit, and not say the average or a learned weighted average? Wouldn’t this bias for/against the number of codes in the visit? - I don’t see why basic embeddings are not fine tuned as well. Did you find that to hurt performance? Do you have an explanation for that? - Looking at Figure 2, the results seem very close and the figures are not very clear (figure (b) top is missing). Also, I am wondering how significant the differences are so it would be nice to comment on that. Finally, I think this is an interesting application paper applying well-established deep learning techniques. The paper deals with an important issue that arises when applying deep learning models in domains with scarce data resources.

"Summary: The authors propose a multi-hop *gated attention* model, which models the interactions between query and document representations, for answering cloze-style questions. The document representation is attended to sequentially over multiple-hops using similarity with the query representation (using a dot-product) as the scoring/attention function. The proposed method improves upon (CNN, Daily Mail, Who-Did-What datasets) or is comparable to (CBT dataset) the state-of-the-art results. Pros: 1. Nice idea on heirarchical attention for modulating the context (document) representation by the task-specific (query) representation. 2. The presentation is clear with thorough experimental comparison with the latest results. Comments: 1. The overall system presents a number of architectural elements: (1) attention at multiple layers (multi-hop), (2) query based attention for the context (or gated attention), (3) encoding the query vector at each layer independently. It is important to breakdown the gain in performance due to the above factors: the ablation study presented in section 4.4 helps establish the importance of Gated Attention (#2 above). However, it is not clear: (1) how much multiple-hops of gated-attention contribute to the performance. (2) how important is it to have a specialized query encoder for each layer. Understanding the above better, will help simplify the architecture. 2. The tokens are represented using L(w) and C(w). It is not clear if C(w) is crucial for the performance of the proposed method. There is a significant performance drop when C(w) is absent (e.g. in *GA Reader--*; although there are other changes in *GA Reader--* which could affect the performance). Hence, it is not clear how much does the main idea, i.e., gated attention contributes towards the superior performance of the proposed method.","The review acknowledges the merits of the paper, highlighting the ""nice idea"" and ""clear presentation.""

"The contribution of this paper can be summarized as: 1, A TransGaussian model (in a similar idea of TransE) which models the subject / object embeddings in a parameterization of Gaussian distribution. The model can be naturally adapted to path queries like the formulation of (Guu et al, 2015). 2. Along with the entity / relation representations trained by TransGaussian, an LSTM + attention model is built on natural language questions, aiming at learning a distribution (not normalized though) over relations for question answering. 3. Experiments on a generated WorldCup2014 dataset, focusing on path queries and conjunctive queries. Overall, I think the Gaussian parameterization exhibits some nice properties, and could be suitable to KB completion and question answering. However, some details and the main experimental results are not convincing enough to me. The paper writing also needs to be improved. More comments below: [Major comments] - My main concern is that that evaluation results are NOT strong. Either knowledge base completion or KB-based question answering, there are many existing and competitive benchmarks (e.g., FB15k / WebQuestions). Experimenting with such a tiny WordCup2014 dataset is not convincing. Moreover, the questions are just generated by a few templates, which is far from NL questions. I am not even not sure why we need to apply an LSTM in such scenario. The paper would be much stronger if you can demonstrate its effectiveness on the above benchmarks. - Conjunctive queries: the current model assumes that all the detected entities in the question could be aligned to one or more relations and we can take conjunctions in the end. This assumption might be not always correct, so it is more necessary to justify this on real QA datasets. - The model is named as “Gaussian attention” and I kind of think it is not very closely related to well-known attention mechanism, but more related to KB embedding literature. [Minor comments] - I find Figure 2 a bit confusing. The first row of orange blocks denote KB relations, and the second row of those denote every single word of the NL question. Maybe make it clearer? - Besides “entity recognition”, usually we still need an “entity linker” component which links the text mention to the KB entity.","The reviewer raises several major concerns about the paper, particularly the limited evaluation on a small, synthetic dataset and the questionable use of an LSTM model.

"Our understanding of GAN to date is still vague. Although there have been some efforts relating GAN to energy models, I personally consider that the perspective of this paper, namelying understanding GAN (a variant of GAN, to be more precise) as variational training of an energy model is the most natural and elegant. The derivation up to equation (5) and the reduction to (7) are very nice. I think this is the most important contribution of the paper. The techniques introduced in sections 5 and 6 are somewhat ad hoc, and lack clarity. Referring to the version I looked at (not sure though if it is the latest), section 6 contain some errors/typos (stuff around p_z(x|	ilde{x}). The presentation of section 6 needs to improve in clarity. But I think this does not shadow the main contribution of the paper, namely, that perspectives given in sections 2-4. Overall I very much enjoy the presented insight of this paper into GAN. I do have some comment/question regarding equation (7). This equation formulates a variant of GAN, or a model resembling GAN. I am happy to see that the entropy term pops up there, which should save GAN from degenerating its generative distribution or from missing modes. The swapping of the min-max order in this formulation however makes me wonder if this variant of GAN indeed reflects the *principle* of GAN, or it is in fact a different principle, which happens to gives rise to a model that *resembles* GAN.

"This paper proposes an interesting application of the GAN framework in steganography domain. In addition to the normal GAN discriminator, there is a steganalyser discriminator that receives the negative examples from the generator and positive examples from the generator images that contain a hidden payload. As a result, the generator, not only learn to generate realistic images by fooling the discriminator of the GAN, but also learn to be a secure container by fooling steganalyser discriminator. The method is tested by training an independent steganalyser S* on real images and generated images. Given that in the ICLR community, not many people are familiar with the literature of steganography, I think this paper should have provided more context about how exactly this method can be used in practice, what are the related works on setganalysis-secure message embedding and probably a more thorough sets of experiments on more than one dataset. The proposed SGAN framework (Figure 2) does make sense to me, and I think it is very general and can have more applications other than the steganography domain. But it is not clear to me why fooling the steganalyser discriminator S, necessarily mean that we can fool an independent discriminator S*? Also I find it surprising that a different seed value, can make such a huge difference in the accuracy.

"This paper proposes an extension of the GAN framework known as GAP whereby multiple generators and discriminators are trained in parallel. The generator/discriminator pairing is shuffled according to a periodic schedule. Pros: + The proposed approach is simple and easy to replicate. Cons: - The paper is confusing to read. - The results are suggestive but do not conclusively show a performance win for GAP. The main argument of the paper is that GAP leads to improved convergence and improved coverage of modes. The coverage visualizations are suggestive but there still is not enough evidence to conclude that GAP is in fact improving coverage. And for convergence it is difficult to assess the effect of GAP on the basis of learning curves. The proposed GAM-II metric is circular in that model performance depends on the collection of baselines the model is being compared with. Estimating likelihood via AIS seems to be a promising way to evaluate, as does using the Inception score. Perhaps a more systematic way to determine GAP*s effect would be to set up a grid search of hyperparameters and train an equal number of GANs and GAP-GANs for each setting.

"The paper discusses a method to learn interpretable hierarchical template representations from given data. The authors illustrate their approach on binary images. The paper presents a novel technique for extracting interpretable hierarchical template representations based on a small set of standard operations.

This insight is then used to formulate a message passing technique which was shown to produce accurate results for these types of problems. Summary: ——— The paper presents an novel formulation for extracting hierarchical template representations that has not been discussed in that form. Unfortunately the experimental results are on smaller scale data and extension of the proposed algorithm to more natural images seems non-trivial to me.

"The authors of the paper explore the idea of incorporating skip connections *over time* for RNNs. Even though the basic idea is not particularly innovative, a few proposals on how to merge that information into the current hidden state with different pooling functions are evaluated. The different models are compared on two popular text benchmarks. Some points. 1) The experiments feature only NLP and only prediction tasks. It would have been nice to see the models in other domains, i.e. modelling a conditional distribution p(y|x), not only p(x). Further, sensory input data such as audio or video would have given further insight. 2) As pointed out by other reviewers, it does not feel as if the comparisons to other models are fair. SOTA on NLP changes quickly and it is hard to place the experiments in the complete picture. 3) It is claimed that this helps long-term prediction. I think the paper lacks a corresponding analysis, as pointed out in an earlier question of mine. 4) It is claimed that LSTM trains slow and is hard to scale.

"The author works to compare DNNs to human visual perception, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Their first result involves performing a psychophysical experiment both on humans and on a model and then comparing the results (actually I think the psychophysical data was collected in a different work, and is just used here). The specific psychophysical experiment determined, separately for each of a set of approx. 1110 images, what the noise level of additive noise would have to be to make a just-noticeable-difference for humans in discriminating the noiseless image from the noisy one. The authors then define a metric on neural networks that allows them to measure what they posit might be a similar property for the networks. They then correlate the pattern of noise levels between neural networks that the humans. Deep neural networks end up being much better predictors of the human pattern of noise levels than simpler measure of image perturbation (e.g. RMS contrast). A second result involves comparing DNNs to humans in terms of their pattern errors in a series of highly controlled experiments using stimuli that illustrate classic properties of human visual processing -- including segmentation, crowding and shape understanding. They then used an information-theoretic single-neuron metric of discriminability to assess similar patterns of errors for the DNNs. Again, top layers of DNNs were able to reproduce the human patterns of difficulty across stimuli, at least to some extent. A third result involves comparing DNNs to humans in terms of their pattern of contrast sensitivity across a series of sine-grating images at different frequencies. (There is a classic result from vision research as to what this pattern should be, so it makes a natural target for comparison to models.) The authors define a DNN correlate for the propertie in terms of the cross-neuron average of the L1-distance between responses to a blank image and responses to a sinuisoid of each contrast and frequency. They then qualitatively compare the results of this metric for DNNs models to known results from the literature on humans, finding that, like humans, there is an apparent bandpass response for low-contrast gratings and a mostly constant response at high contrast. Pros: * The general concept of comparing deep nets to psychophysical results in a detailed, quantitative way, is really nice. * They nicely defined a set of *linking functions*, e.g. metrics that express how a specific behavioral result is to be generated from the neural network. (Ie. the L1 metrics in results 1 and 3 and the information-theoretic measure in result 2.) The framework for setting up such linking functions seems like a great direction to me. * The actual psychophysical data seems to have been handled in a very careful and thoughtful way. These folks clearly know what they*re doing on the psychophysical end. Cons: * To my mind, the biggest problem wit this paper is that that it doesn*t say something that we didn*t really know already. Existing results have shown that DNNs are pretty good models of the human visual system in a whole bunch of ways, and this paper adds some more ways. What would have been great would be: (a) showing that they metric of comparison to humans that was sufficiently sensitive that it could pull apart various DNN models, making one clearly better than the others. (b) identifying a wide gap between the DNNs and the humans that is still unfilled. They sort of do this, since while the DNNs are good at reproducing the human judgements in Result 1, they are not perfect -- gap is between 60% explained variance and 84% inter-human consistency. This 24% gap is potentially important, so I*d really like to see them have explored that gap more -- e.g. (i) widening the gap by identifying which images caused the gap most and focusing a test on those, or (ii) closing the gap by training a neural network to get the pattern 100% correct and seeing if that made better CNNs as measured on other metrics/tasks. In other words, I would definitely have traded off not having results 2 and 3 for a deeper exploration of result 1. I think their overall approach could be very fruitful, but it hasn*t really been carried far enough here. * I found a few things confusing about the layout of the paper. I especially found that the quantitative results for results 2 and 3 were not clearly displayed. Why was figure 8 relegated to the appendix? Where are the quantifications of model-human similarities for the data shown in Figure 8? Isn*t this the whole meat of their second result? This should really be presented in a more clear way. * Where is the quantification of model-human similarity for the data show in Figure 3? Isn*t there a way to get the human contrast-sensitivity curve and then compare it to that of models in a more quantitively precise way, rather than just note a qualitative agreement? It seems odd to me that this wasn*t done.","The review acknowledges the positive aspects of the paper, such as the innovative approach and careful data handling ('really nice', 'great direction', 'know what they're doing').

"In this paper, the authors proposed an implicit ResoNet model for knowledge base completion. The proposed model performs inference implicitly by a search controller and shared memory. The proposed approach demonstrates promising results on FB15k benchmark dataset. Pros: - The proposed approach demonstrates strong performance on FB15k dataset. - The idea of using shared memory for knowledge base completion is new and interesting. - The proposed approach is general and can be applied in various tasks. Cons: - There is no qualitative analysis on the results, and it is hard to see why the proposed approach works on the knowledge-base completion task. - The introduction section can be improved. Specifically, the authors should motivate *shared memory* more in the introduction and how it different from existing methods that using *unshared memory* for knowledge base completion.

"This paper attempts to learn a Markov chain to estimate a probability distribution over latent variables Z, such that P(X | Z) can be eased to generate samples from a data distribution. The paper in its current form is not acceptable due to the following reasons: 1. No quantitative evaluation. The authors do include samples from the generative model, which however are insufficient to judge performance of the model. See comment 2. 2. The description of the model is very unclear. I had to indulge in a lot of charity to interpret what the authors *must be doing*. What does Q(Z) mean? Does it mean the true posterior P(Z | X) ? What is the generative model here? Typically, it*s P(Z)P(X|Z). VAEs use a variational approximation Q(Z | X) to the true posterior P(Z | X). Are you trying to say that your model can sample from the true posterior P(Z | X)?

"The paper introduced an extension of Adam optimizer that automatically adjust learning rate by comparing the subsequent values of the cost function during training. The authors empirically demonstrated the benefit of the Eve optimizer on CIFAR convnets, logistic regression and RNN problems. I have the following concerns about the paper - The proposed method is VARIANT to arbitrary shifts and scaling to the cost function. - A more fair comparison with other baseline methods would be using additional exponential decay learning scheduling between the lower and upper threshold of d_t. I suspect 1/d_t just shrinks as an exponential decay from Figure 2. - Three additional hyper-parameters: k, K, eta_3.

"First up, I want to point out that this paper is really long. Like 17 pages long -- without any supplementary material. While ICLR does not have an official page limit, it would be nice if authors put themselves in the reviewer*s shoes and did not take undue advantage of this rule. Having 1 or 2 pages in addition to the conventional 8 page limit is ok, but more than doubling the pages is quite unfair. Now for the review: The paper proposes a new artificial dataset for sequence learning. I call it artificial because it was artificially generated from the original MNIST dataset which is a smallish dataset of real images of handwritten digits. In addition to the dataset, the authors propose to train recurrent networks using a schedule over the length of the sequence, which they call *incremental learning*. The experiments show that their proposed schedule is better than not having any schedule on this data set. Furthermore, they also show that their proposed schedule is better than a few other intuitive schedules. The authors verify this by doing some ablation studies over the model on the proposed dataset. I have following issues with this paper: -- I did not find anything novel in this paper. The proposed incremental learning schedule is nothing new and is a natural thing to try when learning sequences. Similar idea have already been tried by a number of authors, including Bengio 2015, and Ranzato 2015. The only new piece of work is the ablation studies which the authors conduct to tease out and verify that indeed the improvement in performance is due to the curriculum used. -- Furthermore, the authors only test their hypothesis on a single dataset which they propose and is artificially generated. Why not use it on a real sequential dataset, such as, language modeling. Does the technique not work in that scenario? In fact I am quite positive that for language modeling where the vocabulary size is huge, the performance gains will be no where close to the 74% reported in the paper. -- I*m not convinced about the value of having this artificial dataset. Already there are so many real world sequential dataset available, including in text, speech, finance and other areas. What exactly does this dataset bring to the table is not super clear to me. While having another dataset may not be a bad thing in itself, I almost felt that this dataset was created for the sole purpose of making the proposed ideas work. It would have been so much better had the authors shown experiments on other datasets. -- As I said, the paper is way too long. A significant part of the length of the paper is due to a collection of experiments which are completely un-related to the main message of the paper. For instance, the experiment in Section 6.2 is completely unrelated to the story of the paper. Same is true with the transfer learning experiments of Section 6.4.","The reviewer expresses multiple negative opinions about the paper.

While the reviewer doesn't resort to personal attacks or overly inflammatory language, the tone is quite critical and dismissive of the work.",-60,20
"Paper summary This paper develops a generalization of dropout using information theoretic principles. The basic idea is that when learning a representation z of input x with the aim of predicting y, we must choose a z such that it carries the least amount of information about x, as long as it can predict y. This idea can be formalized using the Information Bottleneck Lagrangian. This leads to an optimization problem which is similar to the one derived for variational dropout, the difference being that Information dropout allows for a scaling factor associated with the KL divergence term that encourages noise. The amount of noise being added is made a parameterized function of the data and this function is optimized along with the rest of the model. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and MNIST show (small) improvements over binary dropout. Strengths - The paper highlights an important conceptual link between probabilistic variational methods and information theoretic methods, showing that dropout can be generalized using both formalisms to arrive at very similar models. - The presentation of the model is excellent. - The experimental results on cluttered MNIST are impressive. Weaknesses - The results on CIFAR-10 in Figure 3(b) seem to be on a validation set (unless the axis label is a typo). It is not clear why the test set was not used. This makes it hard to compare to results reported in Springenberg et al, as well as other results in literature. Quality The theoretical exposition is high quality. Figure 2 gives a nice qualitative assessment of what the model is doing. However, the experimental results section can be made better, for example, by matching the results on CIFAR-10 as reported in Springenberg et al. and trying to improve on those using information dropout. Clarity The paper is well written and easy to follow. Originality The derivation of the information dropout optimization problem using IB Lagrangian is novel. However, the final model is quite close to variational dropout. Significance This paper will be of general interest to researchers in representation learning because it highlights an alternative way to think about latent variables (as information bottlenecks). However, unless the model can be shown to achieve significant improvements over simple dropout, its wider impact is likely to be limited. Overall The paper presents an insightful theoretical derivation and good preliminary results. The experimental section can be improved. Minor comments and suggestions - - expecially -> especially - trough -> through - There is probably a minus sign missing in the expression for H(y|z) above Eq (2). - Figure 3(a) has error bars, but 3(b) doesn*t. It might be a good idea to have those for Figure 3(b) as well. - Please consider comparing Figure 2 with the activity map of a standard CNN trained with binary dropout, so we can see if similar filtering out is happening there already.","The review acknowledges the strengths of the paper, such as the clear presentation and interesting theoretical connection.

"Summary: The authors present a simple RNN with linear dynamics for language modeling. The linear dynamics greatly enhance the interpretability of the model, as well as provide the potential to improve performance by caching the dynamics for common sub-sequences. Overall, the quantitative comparison on a benchmark task is underwhelming. It’s unclear why the authors didn’t consider a more common dataset, and they only considered a single dataset. On the other hand, they present a number of well-executed techniques for analyzing the behavior of the model, many of which would be impossible to do for a non-linear RNN. Overall, I recommend that the paper is accepted, despite the results. It provides an interesting read and an important contribution to the research dialogue. Feedback The paper could be improved by shortening the number of analysis experiments and increasing the discussion of related sequence models. Some of the experiments were very compelling, whereas some of them (eg. 4.6) sort of feels like you’re just showing the reader that the model fits the data well, not that the model has any particularly important property. We trust that the model fits the data well, since you get reasonable perplexity results. LSTMS/GRUs are great for for language modeling for data with rigid combinatorial structure, such as nested parenthesis. It would have been nice if you compared your model to non-linear methods on this sort of data. Don’t be scared of negative results! It would be interesting if the non-linear methods were substantially better on these tasks. You should definitely add a discussion of Belanger and Kakade 2015 to the related work. They have different motivations (fast, scalable learning algorithms) rather than you (interpretable latent state dynamics and simple credit assignment for future predictions given past). On the other hand, they also have linear dynamics, and look at the singular vectors of the transition matrix to analyze the model. More broadly, it would be useful for readers if you discussed LDS more directly. A lot of this comparison came up in the openreview discussion, and I recommend folding this into the paper. For example, it would be useful to emphasize that the bias vectors correspond to columns of the Kalman gain matrix. One last thing regarding LDS: your model corresponds to Kalman filtering but in an LDS you can also do Kalman smoothing, where state vectors are inferred using the future in addition to the past observations. Could you do something similar in your model? What if you said that each matrix is a sparse/convex combination of a set of dictionary matrices? This parameter sharing could provide even more interpretability, since the characters are then represented by the low-dimensional weights used to combine the dictionary elements. This could also provide more scalability to word-level problems.","The reviewer explicitly recommends acceptance and finds the work interesting and a valuable contribution.

"This paper combines DRQN with eligibility traces, and also experiment with the Adam optimizer for optimizing the q-network. This direction is worth exploring, and the experiments demonstrate the benefit from using eligibility traces and Adam on two Atari games. The methods themselves are not novel. Thus, the primary contributions are (1) applying eligibility traces and Adam to DRQN and (2) the experimental evaluation. The paper is well-written and easy to understand. The experiments provide quantitative results and detailed qualitative intuition for how and why the methods perform as they do. However, with only two Atari games in the results, it is difficult to tell how well it the method would perform more generally.

"This paper introduces a large-scale multi-model product classification system. The model consists of three modules, Image CNN (VGG 16 architecture), text CNN (Kim 2014) and decision-level fusion policies. The authors have tried several fusion methods: including policies taking inputs from text and image CNN probabilities; choose either CNN; average the predictions; end-to-end training. Experimental results show that text CNN alone works better than image CNN and multi-model fusion can improve the accuracy by a small margin. It is a little bit surprising that end-to-end feature level fusion works worse than text CNN alone. The writing is clear and there are a lot of useful practical experiences of learning large-scale model. However, I lean toward rejecting the paper because the following: 1) No other dataset reported. The authors haven*t mentioned releasing the walmart dataset and it is going to be really hard to reproduce the results without the dataset. 2) Technical novelty is limited. All the decision-level fusion policies have been investigated by some previous methods before. 3) Performance gain is also limited.","The reviewer acknowledges the clear writing and practical insights but leans towards rejection due to limited novelty, dataset availability concerns, and marginal performance gains.

"This paper proposes a method for iteratively improving the output of an existing machine translation by identifying potential mistakes and proposing a substitution, in this case using an attention-based model. It is motivated by the method in which (it is assumed) human translators operate. The paper is interesting and imaginative. However, in general terms, I am somewhat sceptical of this kind of approach -- whereby a machine learning method is used to identify and correct the predictions of another method, or itself -- because in the first case, if the new method is better, why not use it from the outset in place of the other method? And in the second case, since the method has no new information compared to previously, why is it more likely to identify more past mistakes and correct them, than identify past correct terms and turn them into new errors? That is unless there is a specific reason that an iterative approach can be shown to converge to a better solution when run over several epochs. This paper does not convince me on these points. Indeed, unsurprisingly, the authors note that *the probability of correctly labelling a word as a mistake remains low (62%)* - this admittedly beats a random-chance baseline, but is not compared to something more meaningful, such as simply contrasting the existing system with a more powerful convolutional model and labelling all discrepancies as mistakes. The oracle experiments are rather meaningless - they just serve to confirm that improving a translation is very easy when the existing mistakes have been identified, but much harder when they are not. Although I do like the paper on the whole, to really convince me that main objective -- ie. that **iterative** improvement is beneficial -- has been satifactorily demonstrated it would be necessary to include stronger baselines - and in particular, to show that an iterative refinement scheme can really improve over a system closely matched to the attention-based model, both when used in isolation and when used in system combination with a PBMT system, and to demonstrate that the PBMT system is not simply acting as a regulariser for the attention-based model. Minor comments: I find the notation excessively fiddly at times - eg F^i = (F^{i,1}, F^{i,|F^i|}) - why use |F^i| here when F is a matrix, so surely the length of the slice is not dependent on i? In the discussion in section 4 - it seems that this still creates a mismatch between the training and test conditions - could anything be done about this?","The reviewer expresses interest and finds the paper imaginative but remains unconvinced about the core argument of iterative improvement.

"The paper introduces the joint multimodal variational autoencoder, a directed graphical model for modeling multimodal data with latent variable. the model is rather straightforward extension of standard VAE where two data modalities are generated from a shared latent representation independently. In order to deal with missing input modalities or bi-directional inference between two modalities the paper introduces modality-specific encoder that is trained to minimize the KL divergence of latent variable distributions between joint and modality-specific recognition networks. The paper demonstrates its effectiveness on MNIST and CelebA datasets, both in terms of test log-likelihoods and the conditional image generation and editing. The proposed method is rather straightforward extension of VAE and therefore the model should inherent the probabilistic inference methods of VAE. For example, for missing data modalities, the model should be able to infer joint representation as well as filling in the missing modalities via iterative sampling as introduced by Rezende et al. (2014). Given marginal improvement, I am not convinced by the contribution of modality-specific encoders in Section 3.3. In addition, the inference methods introduced for generating Figure 5 looks somewhat unprincipled; I am wondering the conditional image generation results by following more principled approach (e.g., iterative sampling). Experimental results on joint image-attribute generation is also missing.","The review acknowledges the paper's work but expresses reservations about its novelty and significance.

"This paper proposes an RNN-based model for recommendation which takes into account temporal dynamics in user ratings and reviews. Interestingly, the model infers time-dependant user/item vectors by applying an RNN to previous histories. Those vectors are used to predict ratings, in a similar fashion to standard matrix factorization methods, and also bias a conditional RNN language model for reviews. The paper is well written and the architectural choices make sense. The main shortcomings of the paper are in the experiments: 1) The full model (rating+text) is only applied to one and relatively small dataset. Applying the model on multiple datasets with more data, e.g. Amazon reviews dataset (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html) would be more convincing. 2) While modelling order in review text seems like the right choice, previous papers (e.g. Almahairi et al. 2015) have shown that for rating prediction, modelling order in reviews might not be useful. A comparison with a similar model, but with bag-of-words reviews model would be nice in order to show the importance of the RNN-based review model, especially given previous literature. Finally, this paper is an application paper applying well-established deep learning techniques, and I do not feel the paper offers new insights which the ICLR community in general would benefit from.

Paper summary: this work proposes to use RNNs inside a convolutional network architecture as a complementary mechanism to propagate spatial information across the image. Promising results on classification and semantic labeling are reported. Review summary: The text is clear, the idea well describe, the experiments seem well constructed and do not overclaim. Overall it is not a earth shattering paper, but a good piece of incremental science.

There is no experimental comparison with other external memory-based approaches (e.g. those discussed in Related Work), or experimental analysis of computational efficiency given overhead costs (beyond just computational complexity) despite that being one of the main advantages.

"This paper proposes a network called Gated Residual Networks layer design that adds gating to shortcut connections with a scalar to regulate the gate. The authors claim that this approach will improve the training Residual Networks. It seems the authors could get competitive performance on CIFAR-10 to state of art models with only Wide Res Nets. Wide Gated ResNet requires much more parameters than DenseNet (and other Res Net variants) for obtaining a little improvement over Dense Net. More importantly, the authors state that they obtained the best results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 but the updated version of DenseNet (Huang et al. (2016b)) has new results for a version called DenseNet-BC which outperforms all of the results that authors reported (3.46 for CIFAR-10 and 17.18 for CIFAR-100 with 25.6M parameters, DenseNet-BC still outperforms with 15.3M parameters which is much less that 36.5M). The Res Net variants papers with state of art results report result for Image Net. Therefore the empirical results need also the Image Net to demonstrate that improvement claimed is achieved.

The improvements are obtained by: 1) replacing the fixed-widow attention with a pointer network, in which the memory only consists of context representation of the previous K identifies introduced for the entire history. 2) a conventional neural LSTM-based language model is combined with such a sparse pointer network with a controller, which linearly combines the prediction of both components using a dynamic weights, decided by the input, hidden state, and the context representations at the time stamp. Such a model avoids the the need of large window size of the attention to predict next identifier, which usually requires a long-term dependency in the programming language. This is partly validated by the python codebase (which is another contribution of this paper) experiments in the paper. While the paper still misses some critical information that I would like to see, including how the sparse pointer network performance chances with different size of K, and how computationally efficient it is for both training and inference time compared to LSTM w/ attention of various window size, and ablation experiments about how much (1) and (2) contribute respectively, it might be of interest to the ICLR community to see it accepted.","The reviewer finds the paper interesting and potentially relevant to the ICLR community, suggesting it ""might be of interest"".

"This paper proposes RaSoR, a method to efficiently representing and scoring all possible spans in an extractive QA task. While the test set results on SQuAD have not been released, it looks likely that they are not going to be state-of-the-art; with that said, the idea of enumerating all possible spans proposed in this paper could potentially improve many architectures. The paper is very well-written and the analysis/ablations in the final sections are mostly interesting (especially Figure 2, which confirms what we would intuitively believe). Based on its potential to positively impact other researchers working on SQuAD, I recommend that the paper is accepted.","The reviewer acknowledges that the paper's results may not be state-of-the-art but finds the proposed method potentially valuable for other researchers.

"The submission proposes to modify the typical GAN architecture slightly to include *encrypt* (Alice) and *decrypt* (Bob) modules as well as a module trying to decrypt the signal without a key (Eve). Through repeated transmission of signals, the adversarial game is intended to converge to a system in which Alice and Bob can communicate securely (or at least a designated part of the signal should be secure), while a sophisticated Eve cannot break their code. Examples are given on toy data: *As a proof-of-concept, we implemented Alice, Bob, and Eve networks that take N-bit random plain-text and key values, and produce N-entry floating-point ciphertexts, for N = 16, 32, and 64. Both plaintext and key values are uniformly distributed.* The idea considered here is cute. If some, but not necessarily all of the signal is meant to be secure, the modules can learn to encrypt and decrypt a signal, while an adversary is simultaneously learned that tries to break the encryption. In this way, some of the data can remain unencrypted, while the portion that is e.g. correlated with the encrypted signal will have to be encrypted in order for Eve to not be able to predict the encrypted part. While this is a nice thought experiment, there are significant barriers to this submission having a practical impact: 1) GANs, and from the convergence figures also the objective considered here, are quite unstable to optimize. The only guarantees of privacy are for an Eve that is converged to a very strong adversary (stronger than a dedicated attack over time). I do not see how one can have any sort of reliable guarantee of the safety of the data transmission from the proposed approach, at least the paper does not outline such a guarantee. 2) Public key encryption systems are readily available, computationally feasible, and successfully applied almost anywhere. The toy examples given in the paper do not at all convince me that this is solving a real-world problem at this point. Perhaps a good example will come up in the near future, and this work will be shown to be justified, but until such an example is shown, the approach is more of an interesting thought experiment.","The reviewer acknowledges the ""cute"" idea and interesting thought experiment but expresses significant reservations about its practical impact and lack of real-world applicability.

"I find the general direction of the work is promising but, in my opinion, the paper has three main drawback. While the motivation and overall idea seem very reasonable, the derivation is not convincing mathematically. The experiments are limited and the presentation needs significant improvement. The writing and wording are in general poorly structured to the point that it is sometimes difficult to follow the proposed ideas. The overall organization needs improvement and the connection between sections is not properly established. The paper could be significantly improved by simply re-writing it. I*m not fully convinced by the motivation for the proposed non-linearity (|c|^2), as described on page 5. The authors argue that (Waldspurger, 2016) suggests that higher order nonlinearities might be beneficial for sparsity. But unless I*m missing something, that work seems to suggest that in the general case higher order nonlinearities can be neglected. Could you please comment on this? On the other hand, adding a second order term to the descriptor seems an interesting direction, as long as stability to small variations is preserved (which should be shown experimentally) The experimental section is rather limited. The paper would be stronger with a thorough numerical evaluation. The presented results, in my opinion, do not show convincingly a clear advantage of the proposed method over a standard implementation of the scattering transform. In order to show the merits of the proposed approach, it would be really helpful to directly compare running times and compression rates. Questions: - Can you show empirically that the proposed higher order nonlinearity produces sparser representations than the complex modulus? Other minor issues: - The proof of Section 2.1, should be preceded by a clear statement in the form of a proposition - *Hadamart* -> Hadamard - *Valid set* -> Validation set - *nonzeros coefficients* -> nonzero coefficients - Figure 3 is difficult to understand. Please provide more details. - Figure 5 is supposed to show a comparison to a standard implementation of the Scattering network, but it doesn*t seem to be such comparison in that figure. Please explain. - Please verify the references.

"The authors present a well thought out and constructed system for performing lipreading. The primary novelty is the end-to-end nature of the system for lipreading, with the sentence-level prediction also differentiating this with prior work. The described neural network architecture contains convolutional and recurrent layers with a CTC sequence loss at the end, and beam search decoding with an LM is done to obtain best results. Performance is evaluated on the GRID dataset, with some saliency map and confusion matrix analysis provided as well. Overall, the work seems of high quality and clearly written with detailed explanations. The final results and analysis appear good as well. One gripe is that that the novelty lies in the choice of application domain as opposed to the methods. Lack of word-level comparisons also makes it difficult to determine the importance of using sentence-level information vs. choices in model architecture/decoding, and finally, the GRID dataset itself appears limited with the grammar and use of a n-gram dictionary. Clearly the system is well engineered and final results impress, though it*s unclear how much broader insight the results yield.","The review starts with positive adjectives like ""well thought out"", ""clearly written"", and ""high quality"".

"The main merit of this paper is to draw again attention to how crucial initialization of deep network *can* be; and to counter the popular impression that modern architectures and improved gradient descent techniques make optimization local minima and saddle points no longer a problem. While the paper provides interesting counter-examples that showcase how bad initialization mixed with particular data can lead the optimization to get stuck at a poor solution, these feel like contrived artificial constructs. More importantly the paper does not consider popular heuristics that likely help to avoid getting stuck, such as: non-saturating activation functions (e.g. leaky RELU), batch-norm, skip connections (resnet), that can all be thought of as contributing to keep the gradients flowing. The paper puts up a big warning sign about potential initialization problems (with standard RELU nets), but without proposing new solutions or workarounds, nor carrying out a systematic analysis of how this picture is affected by most commonly used current heuristic techniques (in architecture, initialization and training). Such a broader scope analysis, especially if it did lead to insights of practical relevance, could much increase the value of the paper for the reader.","The review acknowledges the paper's value in highlighting an important issue (positive). However, it criticizes the paper for artificial examples and lack of exploration of common solutions, suggesting the paper's scope limits its value (negative).

"The author proposes the use of low-rank matrix in feedfoward and RNNs. In particular, they try their approach in a GRU and a feedforward highway network. Author also presents as a contribution the passthrough framework, which can describe feedforward and recurrent networks. However, this framework seems hardly novel, relatively to the formalism introduced by LSTM or highway networks. An empirical evaluation is performed on different datasets (MNIST, memory/addition tasks, sequential permuted MNIST and character level penntreebank). However, there are few problems with the evaluation: - In the highway network experiment, the author does not compare with a baseline. We can not assess what it the impact of the low-rank parameterization. Also, it would be interesting to compare the result with a highway network that have this capacity bottleneck across layer (first layer of size , second layer of size , third layer of size ) and not in the gate functions. Also, how did you select the hyperparameter values?. - It is unfortunate that the character level penntreebank does not use the same experimental setting than previous works as it prevents from direct comparison. Also the overall bpc perplexity seems relatively high for this dataset. It is therefore not clear how low-rank decomposition would perform on this task applied on a stronger baseline. -Author claims state-of-art in the memory task. However, their approach uses more parameters than the uRNN (41K against 6.5K for the memory) which makes the comparison a little bit unfair toward uRNN. It would be informative to see how low-rank RNN performs using overall 6.5K parameters. Generally, it would be good to see what is the impact of the matrix rank given a fix state size. - It would be informative as well to have the baseline and the uRNN curve in Figure 2 for the memory/addition task. - it is not clear when to use low-rank or low-rank + diagonal from the experiments. Overall, the evaluation in its current form in not really convincing, except for the sequential MNIST dataset.","The review is critical of the paper, pointing out several flaws in the evaluation and novelty of the work.

"Paper Summary: This paper presents a new large scale machine reading comprehension dataset called MS MARCO. It is different from existing datasets in that the questions are real user queries, the context passages are real web documents, and free form answers are generated by humans instead of spans in the context. The paper also includes some analysis of the dataset and performance of QA models on the dataset. Paper Strengths: -- The questions in the dataset are real queries from users instead of humans writing questions given some context. -- Context passages are extracted from real web documents which are used by search engines to find answers to the given query. -- Answers are generated by humans instead of being spans in context. -- It is large scale dataset, with an aim of 1 million queries. Current release includes 100,000 queries. Paper Weaknesses: -- The authors say, *We have found that the distribution of actual questions users ask intelligent agents can be very different from those conceived from crowdsourcing them from the text.*, but the statement is not backed up with any study. -- The paper doesn*t clearly present what additional information can today*s QA models learn from MS MARCO which they can*t from existing datasets. -- The paper should talk about what challenges are involved in obtaining a good performance on this dataset. -- What are the human performances as compared to the models presented in the paper? -- In section 4.1, what are the train/test splits? The results are for the subset of MS MARCO where every query has multiple answers. How big is that subset? -- What is DSSM mentioned in row 2, Table 5? -- The authors should include in the paper how experiments in section 4.2 prove that MS MARCO is a better dataset. -- In Table 6, the performance of Memory Networks is already close to Best Passage. Does that mean there is not enough room for improvement there? -- The paper seems to be written in hurry, with partial analysis, evaluation and various mistakes in the text. Preliminary Evaluation: The proposed dataset MS MARCO is unique from existing datasets as it is a good representative of the QA task encountered by search engines.

"The authors propose a *hierarchical* attention model for video captioning. They introduce a model composed of three parts: the temporal modeler (TEM) that takes as input the video sequence and outputs a sequential representation of the video to the HAM; the hierarchical attention/memory mechanism (HAM) implements a soft-attention mechanism over the sequential video representation; and finally a decoder that generates a caption. Related to the second series of questions above, it seems as though the authors have chosen to refer to their use of an LSTM (or equivalent RNN) as the output of the Bahdanau et al (2015) attention mechanism as a hierarchical memory mechanism. I am actually sympathetic to this terminology in the sense that the recent popularity of memory-based models seems to neglect the memory implicit in the LSTM state vector, but that said, this seems to seriously misrepresent the significance fo the contribution of this paper. I appreciate the ablation study presented in Table 1. Not enough researchers bother with this kind of analysis. But it does show that the value of the contributions is not actually clear. In particular the case for the TEM is quite weak. Regarding the quantitative evaluation presented in Table 2, the authors are carving out a fairly specific set of features to describe the set of *fair* comparators from the literature. Given the variability of the models and alternate training datasets that are in use, I would find it more compelling if the authors just set about trying to achieve the best results they can, if that includes the fine-tuning of the frame model, so be it. The value of this work is as an application paper, so the discovery and incorporation of elements that can significantly improve performance would seems warranted. Overall, at this point, I do not see a sufficient contribution to warrant publication in ICLR.","The reviewer raises several concerns and doesn't see the work as a significant contribution in its current form. They question the novelty of the hierarchical memory mechanism, find weak evidence for the temporal modeler's effectiveness, and suggest the authors should aim for better overall results even if it involves using existing techniques. The language is critical but professional and not overtly rude. ",-50,20
"The authors introduce some new prior and approximate posterior families for variational autoencoders, which are compatible with the reparameterization trick, as well as being capable of expressing multiple modes. They also introduce a gating mechanism between prior and posterior. They show improvements on bag of words document modeling, and dialogue response generation. The original abstract is overly strong in its assertion that a unimodal latent prior p(z) cannot fit a multimodal marginal int_z p(x|z)p(x)dz with a DNN response model p(x|z) (*it cannot possibly capture more complex aspects of the data distribution*, *critical restriction*, etc). While the assertion that a unimodal latent prior is necessary to model multimodal observations is false, there are sensible motivations for the piecewise constant prior and posterior. For example, if we think of a VAE as a sort of regularized autoencoder where codes are constrained to *fill up* parts of the prior latent space, then there is a sphere-packing argument to be made that filling a Gaussian prior with Gaussian posteriors is a bad use of code space. Although the authors don*t explore this much, a hypercube-based tiling of latent code space is a sensible idea. As stated, I found the message of the paper to be quite sloppy with respect to the concept of *multi-modality.* There are 3 types of multimodality at play here: multimodality in the observed marginal distribution p(x), which can be captured by any deep latent Gaussian model, multimodality in the prior p(z), which makes sense in some situations (e.g. a model of MNIST digits could have 10 prior modes corresponding to latent codes for each digit class), and multimodality in the posterior z for a given observation x_i, q(z_i|x_i). The final type of multimodality is harder to argue for, except in so far as it allows the expression of flexibly shaped distributions without highly separated modes. I believe flexible posterior approximations are important to enable fine-grained and efficient tiling of latent space, but I don*t think these need to have multiple strong modes. I would be interested to see experiments demonstrating otherwise for real world data. I think this paper should be more clear about the different types of multi-modality and which parts of their analysis demonstrate which ones. I also found it unsatisfactory that the piecewise variable analysis did not show different components of the multi-modal prior corresponding to different words, but rather just a separation between the Gaussian and the piecewise variables. As I mention in my earlier questions, I found it surprising that the learned variance and mean for the Gaussian prior helps so dramatically with G-NVDM likelihood when the powerful networks transforming to and from latent space should make it scale-invariant. Explicitly separating out the contributions of a reimplemented base model, prior-posterior interpolation and the learned prior parameters would strengthen these experiments. Overall, the very strong improvements on the text modeling task over NVDM seem hard to understand, and I would like to see an ablation analysis of all the differences between that model and the proposed one. The fact that adding more constant components helps for document modeling is interesting, and it would be nice to see more qualitative analysis of what the prior modes represent. I also would be surprised if posterior modes were highly separated, and if they were it would be interesting to explore if they corresponded to e.g. ambiguous word-senses. The experiments on dialog modeling are mostly negative results, quantitatively. The observation that the the piecewise constant variables encode time-related words and the Gaussian variables encode sentiment is interesting, especially since it occurs in both sets of experiments. This is actually quite interesting, and I would be interested in seeing analysis of why this is the case. As above, I would like to see an analysis of the sorts of words that are encoded in the different prior modes and whether they correspond to e.g. groups of similar holidays or days. In conclusion, I think the piecewise constant variational family is a good idea, although it is not well-motivated by the paper. The experimental results are very good for document modeling, but without ablation analysis against the baseline it is hard to see why they should be with such a small modification in G-NVDM. The fact that H-NVDM performs better is interesting, though. This paper should better motivate the need for different types of multi-modality, and demonstrate that those sorts of things are actually being captured by the model. As it is, the paper introduces an interesting variational family and shows that it performs better for some tasks, but the motivation and analysis is not clearly focused. To demonstrate that this is a broadly applicable family, it would also be good to do experiments on a more standard datasets like MNIST. Even without an absolute log-likelihood improvement, if the method yielded interpretable multiple modes this would be a valuable contribution.","The review is mixed, leaning slightly towards the positive. It acknowledges the paper's contributions (new prior and posterior families, gating mechanism) and finds the experimental results for document modeling promising. However, it criticizes the paper's clarity, particularly regarding the concept of multi-modality, and calls for more in-depth analysis and ablation studies. The reviewer also suggests additional experiments to strengthen the paper's claims. The language used is generally neutral and professional, with constructive criticism offered throughout.",20,60
"This paper proposes a model-based reinforcement learning approach focusing on predicting future rewards given a current state and future actions. This is achieved with a *residual recurrent neural network*, that outputs the expected reward increase at various time steps in the future. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, experiments are conducted on Atari games, with a simple playing strategy that consists in evaluating random sequences of moves and picking the one with highest expected reward (and low enough chance of dying). Interestingly, out of the 3 games tested, one of them exhibits better performance when the agent is trained in a multitask setting (i.e. learning all games simultaneously), hinting that transfer learning is occurring. This submission is easy enough to read, and the reward prediction architecture looks like an original and sound idea. There are however several points that I believe prevent this work from reaching the ICLR bar, as detailed below. The first issue is the discrepancy between the algorithm proposed in Section 3 vs its actual implementation in Section 4 (experiments): in Section 3 the output is supposed to be the expected accumulated reward in future time steps (as a single scalar), while in experiments it is instead two numbers, one which is the probability of dying and another one which is the probability of having a higher score without dying. This might work better, but it also means the idea as presented in the main body of the paper is not actually evaluated (and I guess it would not work well, as otherwise why implement it differently?) In addition, the experimental results are quite limited: only on 3 games that were hand-picked to be easy enough, and no comparison to other RL techniques (DQN & friends). I realize that the main focus of the paper is not about exhibiting state-of-the-art results, since the policy being used is only a simple heuristic to show that the model predictions can ne used to drive decisions. That being said, I think experiments should have tried to demonstrate how to use this model to obtain better reinforcement learning algorithms: there is actually no reinforcement learning done here, since the model is a supervised algorithm, used in a manually-defined hardcoded policy. Another question that could have been addressed (but was not) in the experiments is how good these predictions are (e.g. classification error on dying probability, MSE on future rewards, ...), compared to simpler baselines. Finally, the paper*s *previous work* section is too limited, focusing only on DQN and in particular saying very little on the topic of model-based RL. I think a paper like for instance *Action-Conditional Video Prediction using Deep Networks in Atari Games* should have been an obvious *must cite*. Minor comments: - Notations are unusual, with *a* denoting a state rather than an action, this is potentially confusing and I see no reason to stray away from standard RL notations - Using a dot for tensor concatenation is not a great choice either, since the dot usually indicates a dot product - The r_i in 3.2.2 is a residual that has nothing to do with r_i the reward - c_i is defined as *The control that was performed at time i*, but instead it seems to be the control performed at time i-1 - There is a recurrent confusion between mean and median in 3.2.2 - x should not be used in Observation 1 since the x from Fig. 3 does not go through layer normalization - The inequality in Observation 1 should be about |x_i|, not x_i - Observation 1 (with its proof) takes too much space for such a simple result - In 3.2.3 the first r_j should be r_i - The probability of dying comes out of nowhere in 3.3, since we do not know yet it will be an output of the model - *Our approach is not able to learn from good strategies* => did you mean **only* from good strategies*? - Please say that in Fig. 4 *fc* means *fully connected* - It would be nice also to say how the architecture of Fig. 4 differs from the classical DQN architecture from Mnih et al (2015) - Please clarify r_j2 as per your answer in OpenReview comments - Table 3 says *After one iteration* but has *PRL Iteration 2* in it, which is confusing - *Figure 5 shows that not only there is no degradation in Pong and Demon Attack*=> to me it seems to be a bit worse, actually - *A model that has learned only from random play is able to play at least 7 times better.* => not clear where this 7 comes from - *Demon Attack*s plot in Figure 5c shows a potential problem we mentioned earlier* => where was it mentioned?","The review is largely critical of the paper, pointing out several flaws in the methodology and results.

"The paper proposed conditional biGAN and its extension to multi-view biGAN. The main idea of conditional biGAN is to matching the latent variable distributions of two encoders, each of which are conditioned on the observation (	ilde{x}) and the output (y), respectively, in addition to standard biGAN formulation. The description on MV-GAN require more revision. Specifically, the definition on aggregating model, Phi, mapping v and a variable s should be clarified. Looking at Equation (8), I can*t find a term that constrains the output domain of function v to be the same as a data domain. Experimental results are not convincing.

The overall algorithm is quite reasonable, but not always described in sufficient details: for example, the thresholds or conditions for neuronal birth or death are not supported by a strong analysis, even if the resulting algorithm seems to perform well on quite extensive experiments. The overall idea is nevertheless interesting (even if not completely new), and the paper generally well written and pretty easy to follow.

"It would seem that the shelf life of a dataset has decreased rapidly in recent literature. SQuAD dataset has been heavily pursued as soon as it hit online couple months ago, the best performance on their leaderboard now reaching to 82%. This is rather surprising when taking into account the fact that the formal conference presentation of the dataset took place only a month ago at EMNLP’16, and that the reported machine performance (at the time of paper submission) was only at 51%. One reasonable speculation is that the dataset may have not been hard enough. NewsQA, the paper in submission, aims to address this concern by presenting a dataset of a comparable scale created through different QA collection strategies. Most notably, the authors solicit questions without requiring answers from the same turkers, in order to promote more diverse and hard-to-answer questions. Another notable difference is that the questions are gathered without showing the content of the news articles, and the dataset makes use of a bigger subset of CNN/Daily corpus (12K / 90K), as opposed to a much smaller subset (500 / 90K) used by SQuAD. In sum, I think NewsQA dataset presents an effort to construct a harder, large-scale reading comprehension challenge, a recently hot research topic for which we don’t yet have satisfying datasets. While not without its own weaknesses, I think this dataset presents potential values compared to what are available out there today. That said, the paper does read like it was prepared in a hurry, as there are numerous small things that the authors could have done better. As a result, I do wonder about the quality of the dataset. For one, human performance of SQuAD measured by the authors (70.5 - 82%) is lower than that reported by SQuAD (80.3 - 90.5%). I think this sort of difference can easily happen depending on the level of carefulness the annotators can maintain. After all, not all humans have the same level of carefulness or even the same level of reading comprehension. I think it’d be the best if the authors can try to explain the reason behind these differences, and if possible, perform a more careful measurement of human performance. If anything, I don’t think it looks favorable for NewsQA if the human performance is only at the level of 74.9%, as it looks as if the difficulty of the dataset comes mainly from the potential noise from the QA collection process, which implies that the low model performance could result from not necessarily because of the difficulty of the comprehension and reasoning, but because of incorrect answers given by human annotators. I’m also not sure whether the design choice of not presenting the news article when soliciting the questions was a good one. I can imagine that people might end up asking similar generic questions when not enough context has been presented. Perhaps taking a hybrid, what I would like to suggest is to present news articles where some sentences or phrases are randomly redacted, so that the question generators can have a bit more context while not having the full material in front of them. Yet another way of encouraging the turkers from asking too trivial questions is to engage an automatic QA system on the fly — turkers must construct a QA pair for which an existing state-of-the-art system cannot answer correctly.","The reviewer finds the dataset valuable and addressing a relevant need in the field (positive).

"For more than a decade, near data processing has been a key requirement for large scale linear learning platforms, as the time to load the data exceeds the learning time, and this has justified the introduction of approaches such as Spark Deep learning usually deals with the data that can be contained in a single machine and the bottleneck is often the CPU-GPU bus or the GPU-GPU-bus, so a method that overcomes this bottleneck could be relevant. Unfortunately, this work is still very preliminary and limited to linear training algorithms, so of little interest yet to ICLR readership. I would recommend publication to a conference where it can reach the large-scale linear ML audience first, such as ICML. This paper is clear and well written in the present form and would probably mostly need a proper benchmark on a large scale linear task. Obviously, when the authors have convincing DNN learning simulations, they are welcome to target ICLR, but can the flash memory FPGA handle it?

"This paper considers the code completion problem: given partially written source code produce a distribution over the next token or sequence of tokens. This is an interesting and important problem with relevance to industry and research. The authors propose an LSTM model that sequentially generates a depth-first traversal over an AST. Not surprisingly the results improve over previous approaches with more brittle conditioning mechanisms (Bielik et al. 2016). Still, simply augmenting previous work with LSTM-based conditioning is not enough of a contribution to justify an entire paper. Some directions that would greatly improve the contribution include: considering distinct traversal orders, does this change the predictive accuracy? Any other ways of dealing with UNK tokens? The ultimate goal of this paper is to improve code completion, and it would be great to go beyond simply neurifying previous methods.

The models described in Bielik et al. 2016 and Maddison & Tarlow 2014 can in principle condition on any part of the AST already generated. The difference in this work is that the LSTM can learn to condition in a flexible way that doesn*t increase the complexity of the computation. - In the denying prediction experiments, the most interesting number is the Prediction Accuracy, which is P(accurate | model doesn*t predict UNK). I think it would also be interesting to see P(accurate | UNK is not ground truth). Clearly the models trained to ignore UNK losses will do worse overall, but do they do worse on non-UNK tokens?","The review starts with a neutral tone, acknowledging the importance of the problem and the improvement over previous approaches. However, it quickly becomes critical, stating that the contribution is not significant enough for a full paper.

"This paper applies the pointer network architecture—wherein an attention mechanism is fashioned to point to elements of an input sequence, allowing a decoder to output said elements—in order to solve simple combinatorial optimization problems such as the well-known travelling salesman problem. The network is trained by reinforcement learning using an actor-critic method, with the actor trained using the REINFORCE method, and the critic used to estimate the reward baseline within the REINFORCE objective. The paper is well written and easy to understand. Its use of a reinforcement learning and attention model framework to learn the structure of the space in which combinatorial problems of variable size can be tackled appears novel. Importantly, it provides an interesting research avenue for revisiting classical neural-based solutions to some combinatorial optimization problems, using recently-developed sequence-to-sequence approaches. As such, I think it merits consideration for the conference. I have a few comments and some important reservations with the paper: 1) I take exception to the conclusion that the pointer network approach can handle general types of combinatorial optimization problems. The crux of combinatorial problems — for practical applications — lies in the complex constraints that define feasible solutions (e.g. simple generalizations of the TSP that involve time windows, or multiple salesmen). For these problems, it is no longer so simple to exclude possible solutions from the enumeration of the solution by just « striking off » previously-visited instances; in fact, for many of these problems, finding a single feasible solution might in general be a challenge. It would be relevant to include a discussion of whether the Neural Combinatorial Optimization approach could scale to these important classes of problems, and if so, how. My understanding is that this approach, as presented, would be mostly suitable for assignment problems with a very simple constraint structure. 2) The operations research literature is replete with a large number of benchmark problems that have become standard to compare solver quality. For instance, TSPLIB contains a large number of TSP instances (http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/). Likewise, combinatorial optimization problems of various difficulties can be found here: http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/glopt/test.html. It would greatly add to the paper depth to compare the NCO solution quality on some of these problems. (The CPLEX solver famously evaluates its own progress on such a public library of problem instances.) 3) The paper should explain more clearly the structure of the critic network, and how it performs the mapping from a sequence of cities into a baseline prediction. 4) Suggestions for Algorithm 1: Line 5, 6: the notation is not clear; would be what’s intended? Line 7: I’m assuming that this assignment must be done , as in lines 5,6? Line 8: is used in two different ways, on the LHS and RHS — slight abuse of notation (but we understand the intent). 5) Suggestions for Algorithm 2: Line 13: same as for Algorithm 1 Line 15: use instead of to indicate multiplication","The reviewer provides constructive criticism, acknowledges the novelty of the paper, and suggests specific improvements.

"The authors introduce a semi-supervised method for neural networks, inspired from label propagation. The method appears to be exactly the same than the one proposed in (Weston et al, 2008) (the authors cite the 2012 paper). The optimized objective function in eq (4) is exactly the same than eq (9) in (Weston et al, 2008). As possible novelty, the authors propose to use the adjacency matrix as input to the neural network, when there are no other features, and show success on the BlogCatalog dataset. Experiments on text classification use neighbors according to word2vec average embedding to build the adjacency matrix.

"This paper proposes a multimodal neural machine translation that is based upon previous work using variational methods but attempts to ground semantics with images. Considering way to improve translation with visual information seems like a sensible thing to do when such data is available. As pointed out by a previous reviewer, it is not actually correct to do model selection in the way it was done in the paper. This makes the gains reported by the authors very marginal. In addition, as the author*s also said in their question response, it is not clear if the model is really learning to capture useful image semantics. As such, it is unfortunately hard to conclude that this paper contributes to the direction that originally motivated it.","The review starts with a mildly positive note acknowledging the sensible nature of the research question.

"The paper proposes a nonlinear regularizer for solving ill-posed inverse problems. The latent variables (or causal factors) corresponding to the observed data are assumed to lie near a low dimensional subspace in an RKHS induced by a predetermined kernel. The proposed regularizer can be seen as an extension of the linear low-rank assumption on the latent factors. A nuclear norm penalty on the Cholesky factor of the kernel matrix is used as a relaxation for the dimensionality of the subspace. Empirical results are reported on two tasks involving linear inverse problems -- missing feature imputation, and estimating non-rigid 3D structures from a sequence of 2D orthographic projections -- and the proposed method is shown to outperform linear low-rank regularizer. The clarity of the paper has scope for improvement (particularly, Introduction) - the back and forth b/w dimensionality reduction techniques and inverse problems is confusing at times. Clearly defining the ill-posed inverse problem first and then motivating the need for a regularizer (which brings dimensionality reduction techniques into the picture) may be a more clear flow in my opinion. The motivation behind relaxation of rank() in Eq 1 to nuclear-norm in Eq 2 is not clear to me in this setting. The relaxation does not yield a convex problem over S,C (Eq 5) and also increases the computations (Algo 2 needs to do full SVD of K(S) every time). The authors should discuss pros/cons over the alternate approach that fixes the rank of C (which can be selected using cross-validation, in the same way as is selected), leaving just the first two terms in Eq 5. For this simpler objective, an interesting question to ask would be -- are there kernel functions for which it can solved in a scalable manner? The proposed alternating optimization approach in the current form is computationally intensive and seems hard to scale to even moderate sized data -- in every iteration one needs to compute the kernel matrix over S and perform full SVD over the kernel matrix (Algo 2). Empirical evaluations are also not extensive -- (i) the dataset used for feature imputation is old and non-standard, (ii) for structure estimation from motion on CMU dataset, the paper only compares with linear low-rank regularization, (iii) there is no comment/study on the convergence of the alternating procedure (Algo 1).","The review starts with a neutral summary of the paper's contributions. While it points out some positive aspects (outperforming linear low-rank regularizers), it also raises several concerns about clarity, motivation, computational complexity, and empirical evaluation. The reviewer offers specific suggestions for improvement, indicating a desire to see the work strengthened rather than rejected outright. Overall, the tone is constructive and helpful, suggesting a mildly positive sentiment.",30,70
"This paper investigates the impact of orthogonal weight matrices on learning dynamics in RNNs. The paper proposes a variety of interesting optimization formulations that enforce orthogonality in the recurrent weight matrix to varying degrees. The experimental results demonstrate several conclusions: enforcing exact orthogonality does not help learning, while enforcing soft orthogonality or initializing to orthogonal weights can substantially improve learning. While some of the optimization methods proposed currently require matrix inversion and are therefore slow in wall clock time, orthogonal initialization and some of the soft orthogonality constraints are relatively inexpensive and may find their way into practical use. The experiments are generally done to a high standard and yield a variety of useful insights, and the writing is clear. The experimental results are based on using a fixed learning rate for the different regularization strengths. Learning speed might be highly dependent on this, and different strengths may admit different maximal stable learning rates. It would be instructive to optimize the learning rate for each margin separately (maybe on one of the shorter sequence lengths) to see how soft orthogonality impacts the stability of the learning process. Fig. 5, for instance, shows that a sigmoid improves stability—but perhaps slightly reducing the learning rate for the non-sigmoid Gaussian prior RNN would make the learning well-behaved again for weightings less than 1. Fig. 4 shows singular values converging around 1.05 rather than 1. Does initializing to orthogonal matrices multiplied by 1.05 confer any noticeable advantage over standard orthogonal matrices? Especially on the T=10K copy task? “Curiously, larger margins and even models without sigmoidal constraints on the spectrum (no margin) performed well as long as they were initialized to be orthogonal suggesting that evolution away from orthogonality is not a serious problem on this task.” This is consistent with the analysis given in Saxe et al. 2013, where for deep linear nets, if a singular value is initialized to 1 but dies away during training, this is because it must be zero to implement the desired input-output map. More broadly, an open question has been whether orthogonality is useful as an initialization, as proposed by Saxe et al., where its role is mainly as a preconditioner which makes optimization proceed quickly but doesn’t fundamentally change the optimization problem; or whether it is useful as a regularizer, as proposed by Arjovsky et al. 2015 and Henaff et al. 2015, that is, as an additional constraint in the optimization problem (minimize loss subject to weights being orthogonal). These experiments seem to show that mere initialization to orthogonal weights is enough to reap an optimization speed advantage, and that too much regularization begins to hurt performance—i.e., substantially changing the optimization problem is undesirable. This point is also apparent in Fig. 2: In terms of the training loss on MNIST (Fig. 2), no margin does almost indistinguishably from a margin of 1 or .1. However in terms of accuracy, a margin of .1 is best. This shows that large or nonexistent margins (i.e., orthogonal initializations) enable fast optimization of the training loss, but among models that attain similar training loss, the more nearly orthogonal weights perform better. This starts to separate out the optimization speed advantage conferred by orthogonality from the regularization advantage it confers. It may be useful to more explicitly discuss the initialization vs regularization dimension in the text. Overall, this paper contributes a variety of techniques and intuitions which are likely to be useful in training RNNs.","The review is positive overall. The reviewer finds the paper interesting, the experiments well-conducted, and the writing clear. They provide constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement, but this is typical of a peer review and does not detract from the overall positive sentiment.

"This paper presents a theoretical and empirical approach to the problem of understanding the expressivity of deep networks. Random networks (deep networks with random Gaussian weights, hard tanh or ReLU activation) are studied according to several criterions: number of neutron transitions, activation patterns, dichotomies and trajectory length. There doesn*t seem to be a solid justification for why the newly introduced measures of expressivity really measure expressivity. For instance the trajectory length seems a very discutable measure of expressivity. The only justification given for why it should be a good measure of expressivity is proportionality with other measures of expressivity in the specific case of random networks. The paper is too obscure and too long. The work may have some interesting ideas but it does not seem to be properly replaced in context. Some findings seem trivial. detailed comments p2 *Much of the work examining achievable functions relies on unrealistic architectural assumptions such as layers being exponentially wide* I don’t think so. In *Deep Belief Networks are Compact Universal Approximators* by Leroux et al., proof is given that deep but narrow feed-forward neural networks with sigmoidal units can represent any Boolean expression i.e. A neural network with 2n?1 + 1 layers of n units (with n the number of input neutron). “Comparing architectures in such a fashion limits the generality of the conclusions” To my knowledge much of the previous work has focused on mathematical proof, and has led to very general conclusions on the representative power of deep networks (one example being Leroux et al again). It is much harder to generalise the approach you propose, based on random networks which are not used in practice. “[we study] a family of networks arising in practice: the behaviour of networks after random initialisation” These networks arise in practice as an intermediate step that is not used to perform computations; this means that the representative power of such intermediate networks is a priori irrelevant. You would need to justify why it is not. “results on random networks provide natural baselines to compare trained networks with” random networks are not “natural” for the study of expressivity of deep networks. It is not clear how the representative power of random networks (what kind of random networks seems an important question here) is linked to the representative power of (i) of the whole class of networks or (ii) the class of networks after training. Those two classes of networks are the ones we would a priori care about and you would need to justify why the study of random networks helps in understanding either (i) or (ii). p5 “As FW is a random neural network […] it would suggest that points far enough away from each other would have independent signs, i.e. a direct proportionality between the length of z(n)(t) and the number of times it crosses the decision boundary.” As you say, it seems that proportionality of the two measures depends on the network being random. This seems to invalidate generalisation to other networks, i.e. if the networks are not random, one would assume that path lengths are not proportional. p6 the expressivity w.r.t. remaining depth seems a trivial concerns, completely equivalent to the expressivity w.r.t. depth. This makes the remark in figure 5 that the number of achievable dichotomies only depends *only* on the number of layers above the layer swept seem trivial p7 in figure 6 a network width of 100 for MNIST seems much too small. Accordingly performance is very poor and it is difficult to generalise the results to relevant situations.","The review is highly critical of the paper's core ideas and methodology. The reviewer finds the core premise (measuring expressivity through the proposed methods) weakly justified and questions the relevance of studying random networks in this context.  The reviewer also points out potential flaws in the experimental setup and finds some results trivial. The language used, while direct and critical, maintains a professional and academic tone. There's no personal attack or disrespectful language used.",-50,60
"In this paper, the authors study the problem of discovering options for reinforcement learning. They introduce the Bi-POMDP model, which is a POMDP where the observations are structured as a pair of elements, with the first element only available to the option-choosing component (the *option level*) and the second element only to the action-choosing component (the *action level*) and the termination component (the *acquisition model*). They also detail the BONN learning model, which consists of three artificial neural network that implement these three components. Finally, they suggest optimizing a tradeoff between the value achieved by the model and the cost of switching between options (the *cognitive effort*), and demonstrate this approach in three simple domains: Cart-Pole, Lunar Lander and two variants of a grid-world maze. The paper is interesting, and adds considerably to the increasing body of research in hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). I found no critical flaws in the paper, but also no high-impact insights or impressive improvements. This paper offers some good ideas that are moderately novel and may advance the field, but has some issues. The first issue is that it is unclear how much easier it is to compose Bi-POMDPs than hand-crafted options or subgoals. If Bi-POMDPs are to alleviate the design costs of using HRL with human-defined structure, one needs to show that the splitting of observations into two elements (x, y) is easier to do well enough. For example, in Section 5 the authors are correct in pointing out that sequences of actions (*macro-actions*) are open-loop, and therefore not as expressive as closed-loop options. However, by setting x empty in all but one experiment, the authors also restrict themselves to open-loop sub-policies, albeit stochastic ones. Such sub-policies may be sufficiently expressive for the simple domains in this paper, but this is unlikely so in more realistic domains. In the MAZE_2 domain, x is the agent*s position relative to the current room. Designing this domain-specific observation model requires domain knowledge, arguably no less than designing relevant subgoals. It is hard to judge the effectiveness of this approach without design principles for these domain-specific observation models, and more realistic experiments to evaluate their quality. Finally, it is revealing that the drive for hierarchy is only achieved by limiting x. In Section 3.3 the authors mention that acquisition of y is *crucial for discovering a good policy: an agent only using the observations x_t would be unable to solve the task*, which suggests that the design choice of x directly impacts one side of the trade-off between the value and the cognitive effort. Such an important factor should be addressed explicitly. The authors may be interested in the paper *Learning and Transfer of Modulated Locomotor Controllers* (Heess et al., 2016), which has a similar split observation model, and suffers from the same issue. The second issue is that the option space seems to be expressive enough to represent y with high fidelity. If this is the case, and if the learned option model indeed maintains a good image of y, then the algorithm is really solving a different problem: reinforcement learning with costly observability of y. This means that it learns how to act given a stale value of y and when to refresh it. It should then be framed accordingly and compared with the relevant literature. It may or may not be as interesting or novel. In contrast, the standard options framework calls for compression of y into the choice of option o (usually in a small finite space). The agent should learn to extract subtask-relevant information from y, in a way that generalizes to unseen states or subtasks. That said, the embedding of y in the option space can be interesting in itself, even if it is lossless (1-to-1). Unfortunately, no such analysis was offered by the authors. Minor issues: - In 3.3: error in citation, (?) appears instead. - In 4.1: it is confusing to say that *the environments are more stochastic* when epsilon is increased. It is the agent*s policy, not the environment, that becomes more stochastic, which is useful for exploration. If this hurts performance, some discussion is needed of why too much exploration is detrimental to learning. In particular, the paper does not make explicit the number of iterations in the experiments, and it is not clear whether learning with larger epsilon is worse after some fixed number of iterations or asymptotically.","The review is mostly positive, highlighting the paper's novelty and contribution to HRL.

"This paper examines computational creativity from a machine learning perspective. Creativity is defined as a model*s ability to generate new types of objects unseen during training. The authors argue that likelihood training and evaluation are by construction ill-suited for out-of-class generation and propose a new evaluation framework which relies on the use of held-out classes of objects to measure a model*s ability to generate new and interesting object types. I am not very familiar with the literature on computational creativity research, so I can*t judge on how well this work has been put into the context of existing work. From a machine learning perspective, I find the ideas presented in this paper new, interesting and thought-provoking. As I understand, the hypothesis is that the ability of a model to generate new and interesting types we *do not* know about correlates with its ability to generate new and interesting types we *do* know about, and the latter is a good proxy for the former. The extent to which this is true depends on the bias introduced by model selection. Just like when measuring generalization performance, one should be careful not to reuse the same held-out classes for model selection and for evaluation. Nevertheless, I appreciate the effort that has been made to formalize the notion of computational creativity within the machine learning framework. I view it as an important first step in that direction, and I think it deserves its place at ICLR, especially given that the paper is well-written and approachable for machine learning researchers.","The reviewer explicitly states that they find the ideas ""new, interesting and thought-provoking.""

"The paper presents an architecture to parallelize the optimization of nested functions based on the method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC) (Carreira-Perpinan and Wang, 2012). This method decomposes the optimization into training individual layers and updating the auxiliary coordinates. The paper focuses on binary autoencoders and proposes to partition the data onto several machines allowing the parameters to move between machines. Relatively good speedup factors are reported especially on larger datasets and a theoretical model of performance is presented that matches with the experiments. My main concern is that even though the method is presented as a general framework for nested functions, experiments focus on a restricted family of models (i.e. binary autoencoders with linear or kernel encoders and linear decoders) with only two components. While the speedup factors are encouraging, it is hard to get a sense of their importance as the binary autoencoder model considered is not well studied by other researchers and is not widely used. I encourage the authors to apply this framework to more generic architectures and problems. Questions: 1- Does this framework apply to some form of generic multi-layer neural network? If so, some experimental results are useful. 2- What is the implication of applying this framework to more than two components (an encoder and a decoder) and non-linear components? 3- It is desired to see a plot of performance as a function of time for different setups to demonstrate the speedup after convergence. It seems the paper only focuses on the speedup factors per iteration. For example, increasing the mini-batch size may improve the speed per iteration but may hurt the convergence speed. 4- Did you consider a scenario where the dataset is too big that storing the data and auxiliary variables on multiple machines simultaneously is not possible? The paper cites an ArXiv manuscript with the same title by the authors multiple times. Please make the paper self-contained and include any supplementary material in the appendix.

"This paper propose a parallel mechanism for stochastic gradient descent method (SGD) in case of gradient can be computed via linear operations (including least square linear regression and polynomial regression problems). The motivation is to recover the same effect compared with sequential SGD, by using a proposed sound combiner. To make such combiner more efficient, the authors also use a randomized projection matrix to do dimension reduction. Experiments shows the proposed method has better speedup than previous methods like Hogwild! and Allreduce. I feel that there might be some fundamental misunderstanding on SGD. **The combiner matrixM generate above can be quite large and expensive to compute. The sequential SGD algorithm maintains and updates the weight vector w , and thus requires O(f) space and time, where f is the number of features. In contrast,M is a f f matrix and consequently, the space and time complexity of parallel SGD is O(f^2) . In practice, this would mean that we would need O(f) processors to see constant speedups, an infeasible proposition particularly for datasets that can have thousands if not millions of features.* I do not think one needs O(f^2) space and complexity for updating M_i * v, where v is an f-dimensional vector. Note that M_i is a low rank matrix in the form of (I - a_i a_i*). The complexity and space can be reduced to O(f) if compute it by O(v - a_i (a_i* v)) equivalently. If M_i is defined in the form of the product of n number of rank 1 matrices. The complexity and space complexity is O(fn). In the context of this paper, n should be much smaller than f. I seriously doubt that all author*s assumptions, experiments, and strategies in this paper are based on this incorrect assumption on space and complexity of SGD. Why one can have speedup is unclear for me. It is unclear what computations are in parallel and why this sequential algorithms can bring speedup if M_i*v is computed in the most efficient way. I suggest authors to make the following changes to make this paper more clear and theoretically solid - provide computational complexity per step of the proposed algorithm - convergence rate analysis (convergence analysis is not enough): we would like to see how the dimension reduction can affect the complexity.","The reviewer points out a fundamental flaw in the paper's core proposal, arguing that the authors' understanding of SGD complexity is incorrect.

"The paper presents a new environment, called Retro Learning Environment (RLE), for reinforcement learning. The authors focus on Super Nintendo but claim that the interface supports many others (including ALE). Benchmark results are given for standard algorithms in 5 new Super Nintendo games, and some results using a new *rivalry metric*. These environments (or, more generally, standardized evaluation methods like public data sets, competitions, etc.) have a long history of improving the quality of AI and machine learning research. One example in the past few years was the Atari Learning Environment (ALE) which has now turned into a standard benchmark for comparison of algorithms and results. In this sense, the RLE could be a worthy contribution to the field by encouraging new challenging domains for research. That said, the main focus of this paper is presenting this new framework and showcasing the importance of new challenging domains. The results of experiments themselves are for existing algorithms. There are some new results that show reward shaping and policy shaping (having a bias toward going right in Super Mario) help during learning. And, yes, domain knowledge helps, but this is obvious.

The experiments suggest comparable performance to models with prior knowledge of the distribution over environments for bandit tasks, and experiments on random maze navigation from vision is shown as well, though the random maze experiments would benefit from a clearer explanation. It was not obvious from the text how their experiments supported the thesis of the paper that the learned RL algorithm was effectively performing one-shot learning. The subject of the paper is also strikingly similar to the recently-posted paper Learning to Reinforcement Learn (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05763.pdf), and while this paper was posted after the ICLR deadline, the authors should probably update the text to reflect the state of this rapidly-advancing field.","The review acknowledges the authors' attempt to address an important issue and finds the experiments to be somewhat promising ('comparable performance', 'experiments...is shown as well'). However, it also points out a lack of clarity and direct support for the main thesis. The mention of a 'strikingly similar' paper suggests concerns about the novelty and timeliness of the work. Overall, the tone is balanced, leaning slightly towards the critical side. Therefore, the sentiment is somewhat positive but with reservations. The language used is polite and professional, employing constructive criticism rather than harsh language.",20,70
The paper proposes an architecture called ReasoNet that reason over the relation. The paper addresses important tasks but there are many other related works. The comparison to other methods are not comprehensive. The Graph Reachability dataset is not a good example to use.,"The review acknowledges the importance of the paper's topic and the proposed architecture but raises concerns about the lack of comprehensive comparison with related works and the choice of dataset. The use of phrases like ""not comprehensive"" and ""not a good example"" indicates a negative sentiment, although the tone is not overly harsh.",-30,60
"The paper presents a repurposing of rectified factor networks proposed earlier by the same authors to biclustering. The method seems potentially quite interesting but the paper has serious problems in the presentation. Quality: The method relies mainly on techniques presented in a NIPS 2015 paper by (mostly) the same authors. The experimental procedure should be clarified further. The results (especially Table 2) seem to depend critically upon the sparsity of the reported clusters, but the authors do not explain in sufficient detail how the sparsity hyperparameter is determined. Clarity: The style of writing is terrible and completely unacceptable as a scientific publication. The text looks more like an industry white paper or advertisement, not an objective scientific paper. A complete rewrite would be needed before the paper can be considered for publication. Specifically, all references to companies using your methods must be deleted. Additionally, Table 1 is essentially unreadable. I would recommend using a figure or cleaning up the table by removing all engineering notation and reporting numbers per 1000 so that e.g. *0.475 +/- 9e-4* would become *475 +/- 0.9*. In general figures would be preferred as a primary means for presenting the results in text while tables can be included as supplementary information. Originality: The novelty of the work appears limited: the method is mostly based on a NIPS 2015 paper by the same authors. The experimental evaluation appears at least partially novel, but for example the IBD detection is very similar to Hochreiter (2013) but without any comparison. Significance: The authors* strongest claim is based on strong empirical performance in their own benchmark problems. It is however unclear how useful this would be to others as there is no code available and the details of the implementation are less than complete. Furthermore, the method depends on many specific tuning parameters whose tuning method is not fully defined, leaving it unclear how to guarantee the generalisation of the good performance.","The reviewer finds the core idea interesting but has major concerns regarding the presentation and rigor. They criticize the writing style as unobjective and overly promotional. The lack of clarity on experimental setup and parameter tuning further contributes to a negative sentiment. However, the reviewer does not completely dismiss the paper, suggesting potential for improvement. Therefore, the sentiment is rather negative but not extremely so. The language used, while direct, avoids overtly rude or unprofessional terms.",-50,20

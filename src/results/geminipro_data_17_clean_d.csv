"The paper introduces a time dependent recommender system based on point processes parametrized by time dependent user and item latent representations. The later are modeled as coupled – autoregressive processes – i.e. the representation of a user/item changes when he interacts with an item/user, and is a function of both the user and the item representations before time t. This is called coevolution here and the autoregressive process is called recurrent NN. The model may also incorporate heterogeneous inputs. Experiments are performed on several datasets, and the model is compared with different baselines. There are several contributions in the paper: 1) modeling recommendation via parametrized point processes where the parameter dynamics are modeled by latent user/item representations, 2) an optimization algorithm for maximizing the likelihood of this process, with different technical tricks that seem to break its intrinsic complexity, 3) evaluation experiments for time dependent recommendation. The paper by the same authors (NIPS 2016) describes a similar model of continuous time coevolution, and a similar evaluation. The difference lies in the details of the model: the point process model is not the same and of the latent factor dynamic model is slightly different, but the modeling approach and the arguments are exactly the same. By the end, one does not know what makes this model perform better than the one proposed in NIPS, is it the choice for the process, the new parametrization? Both are quite similar. There is no justification on the choice of the specific form of the point process in the two papers. Did the authors tried other forms as well? The same remark applies for the form of the dynamical process: the non-linearity used for the modeling of the latent user/item vectors here is limited to a sigmoid function, which probably does not change much w.r.t. a linear model, but there is no evidence of the role of this non linearity in the paper. Note that there are some inconsistencies between the results in the two papers. Concerning the evaluation, the authors introduce two criteria. I did not get exactly how they evaluate the item recommendation: it is mentioned that at each time t, the model predicts the item the user will interact with. Do you mean, the next item the user will interact with after time t? For the time prediction, why is it a relevant metric for recommendation? A comparison of the complexity, or execution time of the different methods would be helpful. The complexity of your method is apparently proportional to #items*#users, what are the complexity limits of your methods. Overall, the paper is quite nice and looks technically sound, albeit many details are missing. On the other hand, I have a mixed feeling because of the similarity with NIPS paper. The authors should have make a better work at convincing us that this is not a marginal extension of previous work by the authors. I was not convinced either by the evaluation criteria and there is no evidence that the model can be used for large datasets.","The reviewer acknowledges the technical soundness of the paper and finds the contributions valuable. However, they express concerns about the lack of novelty compared to the authors' previous work and raise several questions about the model's justification and evaluation. The language used is critical but professional and maintains a respectful tone. Therefore, the sentiment is moderately positive, leaning towards neutral due to the concerns raised.",40,60
"This paper proposes the RIMs that unrolls variational inference procedure. The author claims that the novelty lies in the separation of the model and inference procedure, making the MAP inference as an end-to-end approach. The effectiveness is shown in image restoration experiments. While unrolling the inference is not new, the author does raise an interesting perspective towards the `model-free* configuration, where model and inference are not separable and can be learnt jointly. However I do not quite agree the authors* argument regarding [1] and [2]. Although both [1] and [2] have pre-defined MAP inference problem. It is not necessarily that a separate step is required. In fact, both do not have either a pre-defined prior model or an explicit prior evaluation step as shown in Fig. 1(a). I believe that the implementation of both follows the same procedure as the proposed, that could be explained through Fig. 1(c). That is to say, the whole inference procedure eventually becomes a learnable neural network and the energy is implicitly defined through learning the parameters. Moreover, the RNN block architecture (GRU) and non-linearity (tanh) restrict the flexibility and implicitly form the inherent family of variational energy and inference algorithm. This is also similar with [1] and [2]. Based on that fact, I have the similar feeling with R1 that the novelty is somewhat limited. Also some discussions should be added in terms of the architecture and nonlinearity that you have chosen.","The reviewer acknowledges the interesting perspective of the paper and its contribution to model-free configurations. However, they disagree with the authors' arguments and find the novelty somewhat limited. The reviewer maintains a neutral yet critical tone throughout the review.",10,50
"This paper presents a modified gated RNN caled GRU-D that deals with time series which display a lot of missing values in their input. They work on two fronts. The first deals with the missing inputs directly by using a learned convex combination of the previous available value (forward imputation) and the mean value (mean imputation). The second includes dampening the recurrent layer not unlike a second reset gate, but parametrized according to the time elapsed since the last available value of each attributes. Positives ------------ - Clear definition of the task (handling missing values for classification of time series) - Many interesting baselines to test the new model against. - The model presented deals with the missing values in a novel, ML-type way (learn new dampening parameters). - The extensive tests done on the datasets is probably the greatest asset of this paper. Negatives ------------- - The paper could use some double checking for typos. - The Section A.2.3 really belongs in the main article as it deals with important related works. Swap it with the imprecise diagrams of the model if you need space. - No mention of any methods from the statistics litterature. Here are the two main points of this review that informs my decision: 1. The results, while promising, are below expectations. The paper hasn’t been able to convince me that GRU-simple (without intervals) isn’t just as well-suited for the task of handling missing inputs as GRU-D. In the main paper, GRU-simple is presented as the main baseline. Yet, it includes a lot of extraneous parameters (the intervals) that, according to Table 5, probably hurts the model more than it helps it. Having a third of it’s parameters being of dubious value, it brings the question of the fairness of the comparison done in the main paper, especially since in the one table where GRU-simple (without intervals) is present, GRU-D doesn’t significantly outperforms it. 2. My second concern, and biggest, is with some claims that are peppered through the paper. The first is about the relationship with the presence rate of data in the dataset and the diagnostics. I might be wrong, but that only indicates that the doctor in charge of that patient requested the relevant analyses be done according to the patient’s condition. That would mean that an expert system based on this data would always seem to be one step behind. The second claim is the last sentence of the introduction, which sets huge expectations that were not met by the paper. Another is that “simply concatenating masking and time interval vectors fails to exploit the temporal structure of missing values” is unsubstantiated and actually disproven later in the paper. Yet another is the conclusion that since GRU models displayed the best improvement between a subsample of the dataset and the whole of it means that the improvement is going to continue to grow as more data is added. This fails to consider that non-GRU models actually started with much better results than most GRU ones. Lastly is their claim to capture informative missingness by incorporating masking and time intervals directly inside the GRU architecture. While the authors did make these changes, the fact that they also concatenate the mask to the input, just like GRU-simple (without intervals), leads me to question the actual improvement made by GRU-D. Given that, while I find that the work that has been put into the paper is above average, I wouldn’t accept that paper without a reframing of the findings and a better focus on the real contribution of this paper, which I believe is the novel way to parametrize the choice of imputation method.","The reviewer highlights both positive aspects (clear task definition, interesting baselines, novel approach, extensive testing) and negative aspects (typos, structural issues, unsubstantiated claims, potentially misleading results). While acknowledging the paper's effort, the reviewer expresses concerns about the validity of some conclusions and the overall impact of the proposed GRU-D model. The tone is critical but professional, focusing on specific areas for improvement. The reviewer's recommendation seems to be 'major revisions' rather than outright rejection.",20,60
"This paper presents a new type of language model that treats entity references as latent variables. The paper is structured as three specialized models for three applications: dialog generation with references to database entries, recipe generation with references to ingredients, and text generation with coreference mentions. Despite some opaqueness in details that I will discuss later, the paper does a great job making the main idea coming through, which I think is quite interesting and definitely worth pursuing further. But it seems the paper was rushed into the deadline, as there are a few major weaknesses. The first major weakness is that the claimed latent variables are hardly latent in the actual empirical evaluation. As clarified by the authors via pre-review QAs, all mentions were assumed to be given to all model variants, and so, it would seem like an over-claim to call these variables as latent when they are in fact treated as observed variables. Is it because the models with latent variables were too difficult to train right? A related problem is the use of perplexity as an evaluation measure when comparing reference-aware language models to vanilla language models. Essentially the authors are comparing two language models defined over different event space, which is not a fair comparison. Because mentions were assumed to be given for the reference-aware language models, and because of the fact that mention generators are designed similar to a pointer network, the probability scores over mentions will naturally be higher, compared to the regular language model that needs to consider a much bigger vocabulary set. The effect is analogous to comparing language models with aggressive UNK (and a small vocabulary set) to a language models with no UNK (and a much larger vocabulary set). To mitigate this problem, the authors need to perform one of the following additional evaluations: either assuming no mention boundaries and marginalizing over all possibilities (treating latent variables as truly latent), or showing other types of evaluation beyond perplexity, for example, BLEU, METEOR, human evaluation etc on the corresponding generation task. The other major weakness is writing in terms of technical accuracy and completeness. I found many details opaque and confusing even after QAs. I wonder if the main challenge that hinders the quality of writing has something to do with having three very specialized models in one paper, each having a lot of details to be worked out, which may have not been extremely important for the main story of the paper, but nonetheless not negligible in order to understand what is going on with the paper. Perhaps the authors can restructure the paper so that the most important details are clearly worked out in the main body of the paper, especially in terms of latent variable handling — how to make mention detection and conference resolution truly latent, and if and when entity update helps, which in the current version is not elaborated at all, as it is mentioned only very briefly for the third application (coreference resolution) without any empirical comparisons to motivate the update operation.","The reviewer finds the core idea interesting and worth pursuing, demonstrated by phrases like ""quite interesting and definitely worth pursuing further"". However, they also list several major weaknesses, indicating a need for significant improvement.  The reviewer is critical of the paper's rushed feel and lack of clarity, using phrases like ""a few major weaknesses"", ""hardly latent"", ""over-claim"", ""not a fair comparison"", ""opaque and confusing"".

"The paper experimentally investigates a slightly modified version of label smoothing technique for neural network training, and reports results on various tasks. Such smoothing idea is not new, but was not investigated previously in wide range of machine learning tasks. Comments: The paper should report the state-of-the-art results for speech recognition tasks (TIMIT, WSJ), even if models are not directly comparable. The error back-propagation of label smoothing through softmax is straightforward and efficient. Is there an efficient solution for BP of the entropy smoothing through softmax? Although the classification accuracy could remain the same, the model will not estimate the true posterior distribution with this kind of smoothing. This might be an issue in complex machine learning problems where the decision is made on higher level and based on the posterior estimations, e.g. language models in speech recognition. More motivation is necessary for the proposed smoothing.","The review starts with a neutral statement, acknowledging the paper's investigation of a slightly modified technique and its application across various tasks. However, the reviewer then poses several questions and requests for improvement, indicating that the paper in its current state might not be ready for publication.

"This paper proposes a method for transfer learning, i.e. leveraging a network trained on some original task A in learning a new task B, which not only improves performance on the new task B, but also tries to avoid degradation in performance on A. The general idea is based on encouraging a model trained on A, while training on the new task B, to match fake targets produced by the model itself but when it is trained only on the original task A. Experiments show that this method can help in improving the result on task B, and is better than other baselines, including standard fine-tuning. General comments/questions: - As far as I can tell, there is no experimental result supporting the claim that your model still performs well on the original task. All experiments show that you can improve on the new task only. - The introduction makes a strong statements about the distilling logical rule engine into a neural network, which I find a bit misleading. The approach in the paper is not specific to transferring from logical rules (as stated in the Sec 2) and is simply relying on the rule engine to provide labels for unlabelled data. - One of the obvious baselines to compare with your approach is standard multi-task learning on both tasks A and B together. That is, you train the model from scratch on both tasks simultaneously (which sharing parameters). It is not clear this is the same as what is referred to in Sec. 8 as *joint training*. Can you please explain more clearly what you refer to as joint training? - Why can*t we find the same baselines in both Table 2 and Table 3? For example Table 2 is missing *joint training*, and Table 3 is missing GRU trained on the target task. - While the idea is presented as a general method for transfer learning, experiments are focused on one domain (sentiment analysis on SemEval task). I think that either experiments should include applying the idea on at least one other different domain, or the writing of the paper should be modified to make the focus more specific to this domain/task. Writing comments - The writing of the paper in general needs some improvement, but more specifically in the experiment section, where experiment setting and baselines should be explained more concisely. - Ensemble methodology paragraph does not fit the flow of the paper. I would rather explain it in the experiments section, rather than including it as part of your approach. - Table 1 seems like reporting cross-validation results, and I do not think is very informative to general reader.","The review is critical of the paper, pointing out several flaws in the experiments and presentation.

"The paper studies the impact of using customized number representations on accuracy, speed, and energy consumption of neural network inference. Several standard computer vision architectures including VGG and GoogleNet are considered for the experiments, and it is concluded that floating point representations are preferred over fixed point representations, and floating point numbers with about 14 bits are sufficient for the considered architectures resulting in a small loss in accuracy. The paper provides a nice overview of floating and fixed point representations and focuses on an important aspect of deep learning that is not well studied. There are several aspects of the paper that could be improved, but overall, I am leaned toward weak accept assuming that the authors address the issues below. 1- The paper is not clear that it is only focusing on neural network inference. Please include the word *inference* in the title / abstract to clarify this point and mention that the findings of the paper do not necessarily apply to neural network training as training dynamics could be different. 2- The paper does not discuss the possibility of adopting quantization tricks during training, which may result in the use of fewer bits at inference. 3- The paper is not clear whether in computing the running time and power consumption, it includes all of the modules or only multiply-accumulate units? Also, how accurate are these numbers given different possible designs and the potential difference between simulation and production? Please elaborate on the details of simulation in the paper. 4- The whole discussion about *efficient customized precision search* seem unimportant to me. When such important hardware considerations are concerned, even spending 20x simulation time is not that important. The exhaustive search process could be easily parallelized and one may rather spend more time at simulation at the cost of finding the exact best configuration rather than an approximation. That said, weak configurations could be easily filtered after evaluating just a few examples. 5- Nvidia*s Pascal GP100 GPU supports FP16. This should be discussed in the paper and relevant Nvidia papers / documents should be cited. More comments: - Parts of the paper discussing *efficient customized precision search* are not clear to me. - As future work, the impact of number representations on batch normalization and recurrent neural networks could be studied.","The reviewer provides a generally positive overview of the paper, stating that it ""provides a nice overview"" and focuses on an important and understudied aspect.

"This paper proposes a simple domain adaptation technique in which batch normalization is performed separately in each domain. Pros: The method is very simple and easy to understand and apply. The experiments demonstrate that the method compares favorably with existing methods on standard domain adaptation tasks. The analysis in section 4.3.2 shows that a very small number of target domain samples are needed for adaptation of the network. Cons: There is little novelty -- the method is arguably too simple to be called a “method.” Rather, it’s the most straightforward/intuitive approach when using a network with batch normalization for domain adaptation. The alternative -- using the BN statistics from the source domain for target domain examples -- is less natural, to me. (I guess this alternative is what’s done in the Inception BN results in Table 1-2?) The analysis in section 4.3.1 is superfluous except as a sanity check -- KL divergence between the distributions should be 0 when each distribution is shifted/scaled to N(0,1) by BN. Section 3.3: it’s not clear to me what point is being made here. Overall, there’s not much novelty here, but it’s hard to argue that simplicity is a bad thing when the method is clearly competitive with or outperforming prior work on the standard benchmarks (in a domain adaptation tradition that started with “Frustratingly Easy Domain Adaptation”). If accepted, Sections 4.3.1 and 3.3 should be removed or rewritten for clarity for a final version.","The review acknowledges the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed method as its strengths, comparing it favorably to existing methods. However, it also points out the lack of novelty as a significant drawback, suggesting the method is almost too straightforward.

"This paper was easy to read, the main idea was presented very clearly. The main points of the paper (and my concerns are below) can be summarized as follows: 1. synchronous algoriths suffer from some struggeling nodes, for which the algorithm has to wait. From my own experience, this has never happend for me on e.g. Amazon EC2 cloud, however, it happens on our own cluster at my university, if the cluster is shared and some users make some nodes very busy. So maybe if the nodes would be dedicated to just user*s job, it wouldn*t be such a big concer (I am not sure what kind of cluster was used to produce Figure 3 and 4). Also how many experiments have you run? In my own experience, most of the time I get the gradient on time from all nodes equality fast, but maybe just in less than 0.1% of iterations I observe that it took maybe twice as long for some node. Also the increasing shape of the curve is somehow implying some weird implementation of communication. Isn*t it only because you are somehow serialize the communication? And it would be maybe much faster if a *MPI_Reduce* would be used (even if we wait for the slowest guy)? 2. asynchronous algorithms are cutting the waiting time, however, the convergence speed may be slower. Moreover, those algorithms can be divergence it special care is not given to stale gradients. Also they have a nice guarantees for convex functions, but the non-convex DNN may cause pain. 3.they propose to take gradient from the first *N* workers out of *N+b* workers available. My concern here is that they focused only on the workers, but what if the *parameter server* will became to slow? What if the parameter server would be the bottleneck? How would you address this situation? But still if the number of nodes (N) is not large, and the deep DNN is used, I can imagine that the communciation will not take more than 30% of the run-time. My largest concern is with the experiments. Different batch size implies that different learning rate should be chosen, right? How did you tune the learning rates and other parameters for e.g. Figure 5 you provide some formulas in (A2) but clearly this can bias your Figures, right? meaning, that if you tune *gamma, eta* for each N, it could be somehow more representative? also it would be nicer if you run the experiment many times and then report average, best and worst case behaviour. because now it can be just coinsidence, right?","The review is quite critical of the paper, pointing out multiple flaws in the methodology and conclusions. The reviewer uses phrases like ""My largest concern is..."", ""it can be just coincidence, right?"", and ""this can bias your figures, right?"" which all point towards a negative sentiment.

"The paper considers Grassmannian SGD to optimize the skip gram negative sampling (SGNS) objective for learning better word embeddings. It is not clear why the proposed optimization approach has any advantage over the existing vanilla SGD-based approach - neither approach comes with theoretical guarantees - the empirical comparisons show marginal improvements. Furthermore, the key idea here - that of projector splitting algorithm - has been applied on numerous occasions to machine learning problems - see references by Vandereycken on matrix completion and by Sepulchre on matrix factorization. The computational cost of the two approaches is not carefully discussed. For instance, how expensive is the SVD in (7)? One can always perform an efficient low-rank update to the SVD - therefore, a rank one update requires O(nd) operations. What is the computational cost of each iteration of the proposed approach?","The review is critical of the paper's novelty, empirical results, and lack of discussion on computational costs.

"This paper proposes a variety of techniques for visualizing learned generative models, focussing specifically on VAE and GAN models.

"The paper introduces supervised deep learning with layer-wise reconstruction loss (in addition to the supervised loss) and class-conditional semantic additive noise for better representation learning. Total correlation measure and additional insights from auto-encoder are used to derive layer-wise reconstruction loss and is further combined with supervised loss. When combining with supervised loss the class-conditional additive noise model is proposed, which showed consistent improvement over the baseline model. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets while changing the number of training examples per class are done extensively. The derivation of Equation (3) from total correlation is hacky. Moreover, assuming graphical model between X, Y and Z, it should be more carefully derived to estimate H(X|Z) and H(Z|Y). The current proposal, encoding Z and Y from X and decoding from encoded representation is not really well justified. Is sigma in Equation 8 trainable parameter or hyperparameter? If it is trainable how it is trained? If it is not, how are they set? Does j correspond to one of the class? The proposed feature augmentation sounds like simply adding gaussian noise to the pre-softmax neurons. That being said, the proposed method is not different from gaussian dropout (Wang and Manning, ICML 2013) but applied on different layers. In addition, there is a missing reference (DisturbLabel: Regularizing CNN on the Loss Layer, CVPR 2016) that applied synthetic noise process on the loss layer.

"This paper applies convnet-based object detection techniques to detection of weather events from 3D climate data, additionally exploring the effect of using an unsupervised autoencoder-style objective term. Pros: The application of object detection techniques to extreme weather event detection problem is unique, to my knowledge. The paper is well-written and describes the method well, including a survey of the related work. The best model makes use of 3D convolutions and unsupervised learning, both of which are relatively unexplored in the detection literature. Both of these aspects are validated and shown to produce at least small performance improvements over a 2D and/or purely supervised approach. Cons: The benefits of the 3D convolutional architecture and unsupervised learning end up being a little underwhelming, with 52.92% mAP for the 3D+semi-sup result vs. 51.42% mAP for the 2D+sup result. It’s a bit strange that 3D+sup and 2D+semi-sup are each worse than the 2D+sup base result; I’d expect each aspect to give a slight improvement over the base result, given that using both together gives the best results -- perhaps there was not a thorough enough hyperparameter search for these cases. The paper does acknowledge this and provide potential explanations in Sec. 4.3, however. As other reviewers pointed out, the use of the 0.1 IoU criterion for true positives is very loose relative to the standard 0.5 criterion. On the other hand, if the results visualized in Figure 3 are typical, a 0.1 overlap criterion could be reasonable for this domain as the detector does seem to localize events well enough that the system could be used to expedite human review of the climate images for extreme events. Still, it would be useful to also report results at higher overlap thresholds. Minor: eq 6 should (probably) be the squared L2 norm (i.e. the sum of squares) rather than the L2 norm itself. Minor: table 4 -- shouldn’t the semi-supervised models have more parameters than the corresponding supervised ones due to the decoder layers? Overall, this paper is well-written and applies some interesting underutilized techniques to a relatively unique domain. The results aren*t striking, but the model is ablated appropriately and shown to be beneficial. For a final version, it would be nice to see results at higher overlap thresholds.","The review is primarily positive, highlighting the paper's novelty, clarity, and exploration of underexplored techniques.

"This paper presents a semi-supervised algorithm for regularizing deep convolutional neural networks. They propose an adversarial approach for image inpainting where the discriminator learns to identify whether an inpainted image comes from the data distribution or the generator, while at the same time it learns to recognize objects in an image from the data distribution. In experiments, they show the usefulness of their algorithm in which the features learned by the discriminator result in comparable or better object recognition performance to the reported state-of-the-art in two datasets.

"The paper describes a recurrent transducer that uses hard monotonic alignments: at each step a discrete decision is taken either to emit the next symbol or to consume the next input token. The model is moderately novel - similar architecture was proposed for speech recognition (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.01281v1.pdf). Soft monotonic alignemts are also enforced by A. Graves in https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850. The difficult part in training the proposed model is backpropagation through the discrete decisions. Typically, reinforcement learning techniques are used. In this contribution, the authors side-step the issue by using a problem-dependent aligner to generate optimal decisions for which they train the model. The results indicate that such specially supervised model is better than the generic soft-attention model that doesn*t require any problem-dependent external supervision. However the authors did not attempt to work on regularizing the soft-attention model, which is not fair - the extra supervision by using the ground-truth alignment is a form of regularization and it could be used as e.g. an extra signal to the soft-attention model for a better comparison.

"Paper summary: This work proposes a new algorithm to generate k-adversarial images by modifying a small fraction of the image pixels and without requiring access to the classification network weight. Review summary: The topic of adversarial images generation is of both practical and theoretical interest. This work proposes a new approach to the problem, however the paper suffers from multiple issues. It is too verbose (spending long time on experiments of limited interest); disorganized (detailed description of the main algorithm in sections 4 and 5, yet a key piece is added in the experimental section 6); and more importantly the resulting experiments are of limited interest to the reader, and the main conclusions are left unclear. This looks like an interesting line of work that has yet to materialize in a good document, it would need significant re-writing to be in good shape for ICLR. Pros: * Interesting topic * Black-box setup is most relevant * Multiple experiments * Shows that with flipping only 1~5% of pixels, adversarial images can be created Cons: * Too long, yet key details are not well addressed * Some of the experiments are of little interest * Main experiments lack key measures or additional baselines * Limited technical novelty Quality: the method description and experimental setup leave to be desired. Clarity: the text is verbose, somewhat formal, and mostly clear; but could be improved by being more concise. Originality: I am not aware of another work doing this exact same type of experiments. However the approach and results are not very surprising. Significance: the work is incremental, the issues in the experiments limit potential impact of this paper. Specific comments: * I would suggest to start by making the paper 30%~40% shorter. Reducing the text length, will force to make the argumentation and descriptions more direct, and select only the important experiments. * Section 4 seems flawed. If the modified single pixel can have values far outside of the [LB, UB] range; then this test sample is clearly outside of the training distribution; and thus it is not surprising that the classifier misbehaves (this would be true for most classifiers, e.g. decision forests or non-linear SVMs). These results would be interesting only if the modified pixel is clamped to the range [LB, UB]. * [LB, UB] is never specified, is it ? How does p = 100, compares to [LB, UB] ? To be of any use, p should be reported in proportion to [LB, UB] * The modification is done after normalization, is this realistic ? * Alg 2, why not clamping to [LB, UB] ? * Section 6, “implementing algorithm LocSearchAdv”, the text is unclear on how p is adjusted; new variables are added. This is confusion. * Section 6, what happens if p is _not_ adjusted ? What happens if a simple greedy random search is used (e.g. try 100 times a set of 5 random pixels with value 255) ? * Section 6, PTB is computed over all pixels ? including the ones not modified ? why is that ? Thus LocSearchAdv PTB value is not directly comparable to FGSM, since it intermingles with #PTBPixels (e.g. “in many cases far less average perturbation” claim). * Section 6, there is no discussion on the average number of model evaluations. This would be equivalent to the number of requests made to a system that one would try to fool. This number is important to claim the “effectiveness” of such black box attacks. Right now the text only mentions the upper bound of 750 network evaluations. * How does the number of network evaluations changes when adjusting or not adjusting p during the optimization ? * Top-k is claimed as a main point of the paper, yet only one experiment is provided. Please develop more, or tune-down the claims. * Why is FGSM not effective for batch normalized networks ? Has this been reported before ? Are there other already published techniques that are effective for this scenario ? Comparing to more methods would be interesting. * If there is little to note from section 4 results, what should be concluded from section 6 ? That is possible to obtain good results by modifying only few pixels ? What about selecting the “top N” largest modified pixels from FGSM ? Would these be enough ? Please develop more the baselines, and the specific conclusions of interest. Minor comments: * The is an abuse of footnotes, most of them should be inserted in the main text. * I would suggest to repeat twice or thrice the meaning of the main variables used (e.g. p, r, LB, UB) * Table 1,2,3 should be figures * Last line of first paragraph of section 6 is uninformative. * Very tiny -> small","The review starts with positive remarks, highlighting the relevance of the topic and acknowledging the novelty of the approach.

"The paper introduced a regularization scheme through soft-target that are produced by mixing between the true hard label and the current model prediction. Very similar method was proposed in Section 6 from (Hinton et al. 2016, Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network). Pros: + Comprehensive analysis on the co-label similarity. Cons: - Weak baselines. I am not sure the authors have found the best hyper-parameters in their experiments. I just trained a 5 layer fully connected MNIST model with 512 hidden units without any regularizer and achieved 0.986 acc. using Adam and He initialization, where the paper reported 0.981 for such architecture. - The authors failed to bring the novel idea.

"The paper proposes to combine graph convolution with RNNs to solve problems in which inputs are graphs. The two key ideas are: (i) a graph convolutional layer is used to extract features which are then fed in an RNN, and (ii) matrix multiplications are replaced by graph convolution operations. (i) is applied to language modelling, yielding lower perplexity on Penn Treebank (PTB) compared with LSTM. (ii) outperformed LSTM + CNN on the moving-MNIST. Both two models/ideas are actually trivial and in line with the current trend of combining different architectures. For instance, the idea of replacing matrix multiplications by graph convolution is a small extension for Shi et al. Regarding to the experiment on PTB (section 5.2), I*m skeptical about the way the experiment carried out. The reason is that, instead of using the given development set to tune the models, the authors blindly used an available configuration which is for a different model.

"Summary: This paper proposes to use surprisal-driven feedback for training recurrent neural networks where they feedback the next-step prediction error of the network as an input to the network. Authors have shown a result on language modeling tasks. Contributions: The introduction of surprisal-driven feedback, which is just the feedback from the errors of the model from the previous time-steps. Questions: A point which is not fully clear from the paper is whether if you have used the ground-truth labels on the test set for the surprisal feedback part of the model? I assume that authors do that since they claim that they use the misprediction error as additional input. Criticisms: The paper is really badly written, authors should rethink the organization of the paper. Most of the equations presented in the paper, about BPTT are not necessary for the main-text and could be moved to Appendix. The justification is not convincing enough. Experimental results are lacking, only results on a single dataset are provided. Although the authors claim that they got SOTA on enwiki8, there are other papers such as the HyperNetworks that got better results (1.34) than the result they achieve. This claim is wrong. The model requires the ground-truth labels for the test-set, however, this assumption really limits the application of this technique to a very limited set of applications(more or less rules out most conditional language modeling tasks). High-level Review: Pros: - A simple modification of the model that seems to improve the results and it is an interesting modification. Cons: - The authors need to use test-set labels. - Writing of the paper is bad. - The authors assume that they have access to the ground-truth labels during the test-set. - Experimental results are lacking","The reviewer raises several serious concerns about the paper, including unclear methodology, poor writing, lack of strong justification and limited experimental validation.

"The authors present TARTAN, a derivative of the previously published DNN accelerator architecture: “DaDianNao”. The key difference is that TARTAN’s compute units are bit-serial and unroll MAC operation over several cycles. This enables the units to better exploit any reduction in precision of the input activations for improvement in performance and energy efficiency. Comments: 1. I second the earlier review requesting the authors to be present more details on the methodology used for estimating energy numbers for TARTAN. It is claimed that TARTAN gives only a 17% improvement in energy efficiency. However, I suspect that this small improvement is clearly within the margin of error ij energy estimation. 2. TARTAN is a derivative of DaDianNao, and it heavily relies the overall architecture of DaDianNao. The only novel aspect of this contribution is the introduction of the bit-serial compute unit, which (unfortunately) turns out to incur a severe area overhead (of nearly 3x over DaDianNao*s compute units). 3. Nonetheless, the idea of bit-serial computation is certainly quite interesting. I am of the opinion that it would be better appreciated (and perhaps be even more relevant) in a circuit design / architecture focused venue.","The review is critical of the work, pointing out limitations and suggesting a more appropriate venue.

"This paper proposes a generative model for mixtures of basic local structures where the dependency between local structures is a tensor. They use tensor decomposition and the result of their earlier paper on expressive power of CNNs along with hierarchical Tucker to provide an inference mechanism. However, this is conditioned on the existence of decomposition. The authors do not discuss how applicable their method is for a general case, what is the subspace where this decomposition exists/is efficient/has low approximation error. Their answer to this question is that in deep learning era these theoretical analysis is not needed. While this claim is subjective, I need to emphasize that the paper does not clarify this claim and does not mention the restrictions. Hence, from theoretical perspective, the paper has flaws and the claims are not justified completely. Some claims cannot be justified with the current results in tensor literature as the authors also mentioned in the discussions. Therefore, they should have corrected their claims in the paper and made the clarifications that this approach is restricted to a clear subclass of tensors. If we ignore the theoretical aspect and only consider the paper from empirical perspective, the experiments the appear in the paper are not enough to accept the paper. MNIST and CIFAR-10 are very simple baselines and more extensive experiments are required. Also, the experiments for missing data are not covering real cases and are too synthetic. Also, the paper lacks the extension beyond images. Since the authors repeatedly mention that their approach goes beyond images, and since the theory part is not complete, those experiments are essential for acceptance of this paper.","The reviewer raises several serious concerns about the paper, both theoretical (lack of clarity on applicability and limitations of the method) and empirical (insufficient experiments, especially for non-image data).

"The authors have put forward a sincere effort to investigate the *fundamental nature of learning representations in neural networks*, a topic of great interest and importance to our field. They propose to do this via a few simplistic pruning algorithms, to essentially monitor performance decay as a function of unit pruning. This is an interesting idea and one that could potentially be instructive, though in total I don*t think that has been achieved here. First, I find the introduction of pruning lengthy and not particularly novel or surprising. For example, Fig 1 is not necessary, nor is most of the preamble section 3.3.0. The pruning algorithms themselves are sensible (though overly simplistic) approaches, which of course would not matter if they were effective in addressing the question. However, in looking for contributions this paper makes, an interesting, pithy, or novel take on pruning is not one of them, in my opinion. Second, and most relevant to my overall rating, Section 4 does not get deeper than scratching the surface. The figures do not offer much beyond the expected decay in performance as a percentage of neurons removed or gain value. The experiments themselves are not particularly deep, covering a toy problem and MNIST, which does not convince me that I can draw lessons to the broader story of neural networks more generally. Third, there is no essential algorithmic, architectural, or mathematical insight, which I expect out of all but the most heavily experimental papers.","The reviewer acknowledges the authors' effort and the importance of the research topic, starting with a mildly positive note. However, the review quickly becomes critical, pointing out the lack of novelty and depth in various aspects.

"The paper proposes an approach to learning models that are good for planning problems, using deep netowork architectures. The key idea is to ensure that models are self-consistent and accurately predict the future. The problem of learning good planning models (as opposed to simply good predictive models is really crucial and attempts so far have failed. This paper is conceptually interesting and provides a valuable perspective on how to achieve this goal. Its incorporation of key RL concepts (like discounting and eligibility traces) and the flexibility to learn these is very appealing. Hence, I think it should be accepted. This being said, I think the paper does not quite live up to its claims. Here are some aspects that need to be addressed (in order of importance): 1. Relationship to past work: the proposed representation seems essentially a non-linear implementation of the Horde architecture. It is also very similar in spirit to predictive state representations. Yet these connections are almost not discussed at all. The related work paragraph is very brief and needs expansion to situate the work in the context of other predictive modelling attempts that both were designed to be used for planning and (in the case of PSRs) were in fact successsfully used in planning tasks. Some newer work on learning action-conditional models in Atari games are also not discussed. Situating the paper better in the context of existing model learning would also help understand easier both the motivations and the novel contributions of the work (otherwise, the reader is left to try and elucidate this for themselves, and may come to the wrong conclusion). 2. The paper needs to provide some insight about the necessity of the recurrent core of the architecture. The ideas are presented nicely in general fashion, yet the proposed impolementation is quite specific and *bulky* (very high number of parameters). Is this really necessary in all tasks? Can one implement the basic ideas outside of the particular architecture proposed? Can we use feedforward approximations or is the recurrent part somehow necessary? At the very least the paper should expand the discussion on this topic, if not provide some empirical evidence. 3. The experiments are very restricted in their setup: iid data drawn from fixed distributions, correct targets. So, the proposed approach seems like an overkill for these particular tasks. There is an indirect attempt to provide evidence the learned models would be useful for planning, but no direct measurement to support this*d claim (no use of the models in planning). Compared to the original Horde paper, fewer predictions are learned, and these are more similar to each other. While I sympathize with the desire to go in steps, I think the paper stops short of where it should. At the very least, doing prediction in the context of an actual RL prediction task, with non-iid inputs, should be included in the paper. This should only require minor modifications to the experiments (same task, just different data). Ideally, in the case of the mazes, the learned models should be used in some form of simplified planning to learn paths. This would align the experiments much better with the claims in the presentation of the architecture.","The reviewer explicitly recommends acceptance, a clearly positive sentiment. However, they also state that the paper ""does not quite live up to its claims"" and list several significant concerns. Therefore, the sentiment is positive but with notable reservations, placing it in the positive spectrum but closer to neutral due to the caveats.

"Summary: This paper looks at the structure of the preimage of a particular activity at a hidden layer of a network. It proves that any particular activity has a preimage of a piecewise linear set of subspaces. Pros: Formalizing the geometry of the preimages of a particular activity vector would increase our understanding of networks Cons: Analysis seems quite preliminary, and no novel theoretical results or clear practical conclusions. The main theoretical conclusion seems to be the preimage being this stitch of lower dimensional subspaces? Would a direct inductive approach have worked? (e.g. working backwards from the penultimate layer say?) This is definitely an interesting direction, and it would be great to see more results on it (e.g. how does the depth/width, etc affect the division of space, or what happens during training) but it doesn*t seem ready yet.","The review acknowledges the paper's potential and interesting direction but ultimately finds it preliminary and lacking in strong results.

"This paper extend the Spin Glass analysis of Choromanska et al. (2015a) to Res Nets which yield the novel dynamic ensemble results for Res Nets and the connection to Batch Normalization and the analysis of their loss surface of Res Nets. The paper is well-written with many insightful explanation of results. Although the technical contributions extend the Spin Glass model analysis of the ones by Choromanska et al. (2015a), the updated version could eliminate one of the unrealistic assumptions and the analysis further provides novel dynamic ensemble results and the connection to Batch Normalization that gives more insightful results about the structure of Res Nets. It is essential to show this dynamic behaviour in a regime without batch normalization to untangle the normalization effect on ensemble feature. Hence authors claim that steady increase in the L_2 norm of the weights will maintain the this feature but setting for Figure 1 is restrictive to empirically support the claim. At least results on CIFAR 10 without batch normalization for showing effect of L_2 norm increase and results that support claims about Theorem 4 would strengthen the paper. This work provides an initial rigorous framework to analyze better the inherent structure of the current state of art Res Net architectures and its variants which can stimulate potentially more significant results towards careful understanding of current state of art models (Rather than always to attempting to improve the performance of Res Nets by applying intuitive incremental heuristics, it is important to progress on some solid understanding too).","The review starts with positive statements, highlighting the paper's insights and contributions.

"Pros: * The general idea behind the paper seems pretty novel and potentially quite cool. * The specific technical implementation seems pretty reasonable and well-thought through. * The general types of the tasks that they try out their approach on spans a wide and interesting spectrum of cognition abilities. * The writing is pretty clear. I basically felt like I could replicate much of what they did from their paper descriptions. Cons: * The evaluation of the success of these ideas, as compared to other possible approaches, or as compared to human performance on similar tasks, is extremely cursory. * The specific tasks that they try are quite simple. I really don*t know whether their approach is better than a bunch of simpler things on these tasks. Taking these two cons together, it feels like the authors basically get the implementation done and working somewhat, and then just wrote up the paper. (I know how it feels to be under a deadline without a complete set of results.) If the authors had used their approach to solve an obviously hard problem that previously was completely unsolved, even the type of cursory evaluation level chosen here would have been fine. Or if they had done a very thorough evaluation of a bunch of standard models on each task (and humans too, ideally), and compared their model to those results, that would have been great. But given the complexity of their methods and the fact that the tasks are either not well-known benchmarks or very challenging as such, it*s really hard to tell how much of an advance is made here.

"The paper proposes to provide a theoretical explanation for why deep convolutional neural networks are invertible (at-least, when going back from certain intermediate layers to the image itself). It does so by considering the invertibility of a single layer, assuming the convolutional filters essentially correspond to incoherent measurements satisfying RIP. In my opinion, while this is an interesting direction of research, the paper is not ready for publication. I feel the treatment does not go sufficiently towards explaining the phenomenon in deep neural networks. Even after reading the response from the authors, I feel the results are only a minor variation of the standard results from compressive sensing for sparse reconstruction with incoherent measurements. A deep neural network is fundamentally different from a single layer---it is the *deep* part that makes the forward task work. As the authors note, there is significant deterioration when IHT is applied recursively----therefore, at best the theory explains the partial invertibility of a single layer. That a single layer is approximately invertible isn*t surprising, that a cascade of layers *is*. For any theoretical analysis of this phenomenon to be useful, I believe it must go beyond analyzing a single compressive measurement-type layer, and try to explain how much of the same theory holds for a cascade. I say this because it*s entirely possible that the sparse recovery theory breaks down beyond a single layer, and invertibility ends up being a property caused by correlations between the weights of different layers. In other words, there is no way to tell from the current results for individual layers whether they are in fact a step towards explaining the invertibility of whole networks.","The reviewer expresses that the paper is ""interesting"" but ""not ready for publication."" They find the approach too simplistic and believe it doesn't adequately address the complexity of deep neural networks.

"This paper proposes to learn groups of orthogonal features in a convnet by penalizing correlation among features in each group. The technique is applied in the setting of image classification with “privileged information” in the form of foreground segmentation masks, where the model is trained to learn orthogonal groups of foreground and background features using the correlation penalty and an additional “background suppression” term. Pros: Proposes a “group-wise model diversity” loss term which is novel, to my knowledge. The use of foreground segmentation masks to improve image classification is also novel. The method is evaluated on two standard and relatively large-scale vision datasets: ImageNet and PASCAL VOC 2012. Cons: The evaluation is lacking. There should be a baseline that leaves out the background suppression term, so readers know how much that term is contributing to the performance vs. the group orthogonal term. The use of the background suppression term is also confusing to me -- it seems redundant, as the group orthogonality term should already serve to suppress the use of background features by the foreground feature extractor. It would be nice to see the results with “Incomplete Privileged Information” on the full ImageNet dataset (rather than just 10% of it) with the privileged information included for the 10% of images where it’s available. This would verify that the method and use of segmentation masks remains useful even in the regime of more labeled classification data. The presentation overall is a bit confusing and difficult to follow, for me. For example, Section 4.2 is titled “A Unified Architecture: GoCNN”, yet it is not an overview of the method as a whole, but a list of specific implementation details (even the very first sentence). Minor: calling eq 3 a “regression loss” and writing “||0 - x||” rather than just “||x||” is not necessary and makes understanding more difficult -- I’ve never seen a norm regularization term written this way or described as a “regression to 0”. Minor: in fig. 1 I think the FG and BG suppression labels are swapped: e.g., the “suppress foreground” mask has 1s in the FG and 0s in the BG (which would suppress the BG, not the FG). An additional question: why are the results in Table 4 with 100% privileged information different from those in Table 1-2? Are these not the same setting? The ideas presented in this paper are novel and show some promise, but are currently not sufficiently ablated for readers to understand what aspects of the method are important. Besides additional experiments, the paper could also use some reorganization and revision for clarity. =============== Edit (1/29/17): after considering the latest revisions -- particularly the full ImageNet evaluation results reported in Table 5 demonstrating that the background segmentation *privileged information* is beneficial even with the full labeled ImageNet dataset -- I*ve upgraded my rating from 4 to 6. (I*ll reiterate a very minor point about Figure 1 though: I still think the *0* and *1* labels in the top part of the figures should be swapped to match the other labels. e.g., the topmost path in figure 1a, with the text *suppress foreground*, currently has 0 in the background and 1 in the foreground, when one would want the reverse of this to suppress the foreground.)","The reviewer acknowledges the novelty and potential of the paper's ideas but points out significant concerns regarding the evaluation, clarity, and potential redundancy in the methodology.

"The paper proposes a method for future frame prediction based on transformation of previous frame rather than direct pixel prediction. Many previous works have proposed similar methods. The authors in their responses state that previous work is deterministic, yet the proposed model also does not handle multimodality. Further, i asked if they could test their method using 2 RGB frames as input and predicting the transformation as output, to be able to quantify the importance of using transformations both as input and output, since this is the first work that uses transformations as input also. The authors dismissed the suggestion by saying *if we were to use RGB frames as input and ask the model to output future frames it would produce very blurry results*, that is, misunderstanding what the suggestion was.

"This paper trains a generative model of image patches, where dictionary elements undergo gated linear transformations before being combined. The transformations are motivated in terms of Lie group operators, though in practice they are a set of fixed linear transformations. This is motivated strongly in terms of learning a hierarchy of transformations, though only one layer is used in the experiments (except for a toy case in the appendix). I like the motivation for this algorithm. The realization seems very similar to a group or block sparse coding implementation. I was disappointed by the restriction to linear transformations. The experiments were all toy cases, demonstrating that the algorithm can learn groups of Gabor- or center surround-like features. They would have been somewhat underpowered five years ago, and seemed extremely small by today*s standards. Specific comments: Based on common practices in ML literature, I have a strong bias to think of as inputs and as network weights. Latent variables are often or . Depending on your target audience, I would suggest permuting your choice of symbols so the reader can more quickly interpret your model. nit: number all equations for easier reference sec 2.2 -- It*s weird that the transformation is fixed, but is still written as a function of x. sec 2.3 -- The updated text here confuses me actually. I had thought that you were using a fixed set of linear transformations, and were motivating in terms of Lie groups, but were not actually taking matrix exponentials in your algorithm. The equations in the second half of this section suggest you are working with matrix exponentials though. I*m not sure which direction I*m confused in, but probably good to clarify the text either way. BTW -- there*s another possible solution to the local minima difficulty, which is the one used in Sohl-Dickstein, 2010. There, they introduce blurring operators matched to each transformation operator, and gradient descent can escape local minima by detouring through coarser (more blurred) scales. sec 3.2 -- I believe by degrees of freedom you mean the number of model parameters, not the number of latent coefficients that must be inferred? Should make this more clear. Is it more appropriate to compare reconstruction error while matching number of model parameters, or number of latent variables? I wonder if a convolutional version of this algorithm would be practical / would make it more suited as a generative model of whole images. ==== post rebuttal update Thank you for taking the time to write the rebuttal!

"The method overall seems to be a very interesting structural approach to variational autoencoders, however it seems to lack motivation as well as the application areas sufficient to prove its effectiveness. I see the attractiveness of using structural information in this context and I find it more intuitive than using a flat sequence representation, especially when there is a clear structure in the data. However experimental results seem to fail to be convincing in that regard. One issue is the lack of a variety of applications in general, the experiments seem to be very limited in that regard, considering that the paper itself speaks about natural language applications. It would be interesting to use the latent representations learned with the model for some other end task and see how much it impacts the success of that end task compared to various baselines.

"This paper makes three main methodological contributions: - definition of Neural Feature (NF) as the pixel average of the top N images that highly activation a neuron - ranking of neurons based on color selectivity - ranking of neurons based on class selectivity The main weaknesses of the paper are that none of the methodological contributions are very significant, and no singularly significant result arises from the application of the methods. However, the main strengths of the paper are its assortment of moderately-sized interesting conclusions about the basic behavior of neural nets. For example, a few are: - “Indexing on class selectivity neurons we found highly class selective neurons like digital-clock at conv2, cardoon at conv3 and ladybug at conv5, much before the fully connected layers.” As far as I know, this had not been previously reported. - Color selective neurons are found even in higher layers. (25% color selectivity in conv5) - “our main color axis emerge (black-white, blue-yellow, orange-cyan and cyan- magenta). Curiously, these two observations correlate with evidences in the human visual system (Shapley & Hawken (2011)).” Great observation! Overall, I’d recommend the paper be accepted, because although it’s difficult to predict at this time, there’s a fair chance that one of the “smaller conclusions” would turn out to be important in hindsight a few years hence. Other small comments: - The cite for “Learning to generate chairs…” is wrong (first two authors combined resulting in a confusing cite) - What exactly is the Color Selectivity Index computing? The Opponent Color Space isn’t well defined and it wasn’t previously familiar to me. Intuitively it seems to be selecting for units that respond to a constant color, but the highest color selectivity NF in Fig 5 i for a unit with two colors, not one. Finally, the very last unit (lowest color selectivity) is almost the same edge pattern, but with white -> black instead of blue -> orange. Why are these considered to be so drastically different? This should probably be more clearly described. - For the sake of argument, imagine a mushroom sensitive neuron in conv5 that fires highly for mushrooms of *any* color but not for anything else. If the dataset contains only red-capped mushrooms, would the color selectivity index for this neuron be high or low? If it is high, it’s somewhat misleading because the unit itself actually isn’t color selective; the dataset just happens only to have red mushrooms in it. (It’s a subtle point but worth considering and probably discussing in the paper)","The reviewer acknowledges weaknesses in the paper, stating the contributions are not ""very significant"" and results not ""singularly significant.""

"The authors explore whether the halting time distributions for various algorithms in various settings exhibit *universality*, i.e. after rescaling to zero mean and unit variance, the distribution does not depend on stopping parameter, dimensionality and ensemble. The idea of the described universality is very interesting. However I see several shortcomings in the paper: In order to be of practical relevance, the actual stopping time might be more relevant than the scaled one. The discussion of exponential tailed halting time distributions is a good start, but I am not sure how often this might be actually helpful. Still, the findings in the paper might be interesting from a theoretical point of view. Especially for ICLR, I think it would have been more interesting to look into comparisons between stochastic gradient descent, momentum, ADAM etc on different deep learning architectures. Over which of those parameters does universality hold?. How can different initializations influence the halting time distribution? I would expect a sensible initialization to cut of part of the right tail of the distribution. Additionally, I found the paper quite hard to read. Here are some clarity issues: - abstract: *even when the input is changed drastically*: From the abstract I*m not sure what *input* refers to, here - I. Introduction: *where the stopping condition is, essentially, the time to find the minimum*: this doesn*t seem to make sense, a condition is not a time. I guess the authors wanted to say that the stopping condition is that the minimum has been reached? - I.1 the notions of dimension N, epsilon and ensemble E are introduced without any clarification what they are. From the later parts of the paper I got some ideas and examples, but here it is very hard to understand what these parameters should be (just some examples would be already helpful) - I.3 *We use x^ell for ell in Z={1, dots, S} where Z is a random sample from of training samples* This formulation doesn*t make sense. Either Z is a random sample, or Z={1, ..., S}. - II.1 it took me a long time to find the meaning of M. As this parameter seems to be crucial for universality in this case, it would be very helpful to point out more explicitly what it refers to.","The reviewer acknowledges the interesting idea but raises several concerns about the paper's practical relevance and clarity.

"In this paper, the authors propose to pretrain the encoder/decoder of seq2seq models on a large amount of unlabeled data using a LM objective. They obtain improvements using this technique on machine translation and abstractive summarization. While the effectiveness of pretraining seq2seq models has been known among researchers and explored in a few papers (e.g. Zoph et al. 2016, Dai and Le 2015), I believe this is the first paper to pretrain using a LM for both the encoder/decoder. The technique is simple, but the gains are large (e.g. +2.7 BLEU on NMT). In addition, the authors perform extensive ablation studies to analyze where the performance is coming from. Hence, I think this paper should be accepted.","The reviewer explicitly recommends acceptance, uses positive language like ""simple, but the gains are large"", and praises the thoroughness of the ablation studies.

"This paper conducts a comprehensive series of experiments on vocabulary selection strategies to reduce the computational cost of neural machine translation. A range of techniques are investigated, ranging from very simple methods such as word co-occurences, to the relatively complex use of SVMs. The experiments are solid, comprehensive and very useful in practical terms. It is good to see that the best vocabulary selection method is very effective at achieving a very high proportion of the coverage of the full-vocabulary model (fig 3). However, I feel that the experiments in section 4.3 (vocabulary selection during training) was rather limited in their scope - I would have liked to see more experiments here. A major criticism I have with this paper is that there is little novelty here. The techniques are mostly standard methods and rather simple, and in particular, there it seems that there is not much additional material beyond the work of Mi et al (2016). So although the work is solid, the lack of originality lets it down. Minor comments: in 2.1, the word co-occurence measure - was any smoothing used to make this measure more robust to low counts?","The reviewer starts with positive remarks, highlighting the comprehensiveness, solidity, and practical usefulness of the experiments.

"The paper shows how group convolutions (for two dimensional commutative groups) can be performed by standard CNNs if the input is warped using a fixed warp. The idea is practical and seems to work well. The paper is well written. I agree with reviewer 1 that the ‘theorems’ do not deserve to be labelled as such. Theorem 1 is equivalent to the second equation from this section of the wikipedia page on convolution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution#Convolutions_on_groups. The existence of Haar measure (from which commutation of Lg and convolution follows immediately) is a well known and elementary theorem in harmonic analysis, which would be treated in the first few pages of any textbook on the subject. It also immediately clear that any commutative group has an additive parameterization (theorem 2). The fact that the paper does not present new deep mathematical results is not a significant weakness in my opinion, but the derivations should not be camouflaged as such. The claim that previous methods that use group convolutions are slow and that the presented approach has better computational complexity is not supported by empirical evidence, and the theoretical analysis is still a bit misleading. For example, the authors write “Unfortunately these approaches do not possess the same memory and speed benefits that CNNs enjoy. The reason is that, ultimately, they have to enumerate all possible transformations”. The presented method also has to enumerate all transformations (in a limited range, on a discretized grid), and this is feasible only because the group is only 2 dimensional (and indeed this is also true for standard CNNs which enumerate translations). As noted in my pre-review question, I believe the computational complexity analysis is not entirely correct, and assume the authors will correct this. Equation 4 is presented as a new invention, but this has been used in previous works and is well known in mathematics, so a citation should be added. The main advantage of the presented method over several earlier methods is that it is very simple to implement, and can re-use highly optimized convolution routines. As I understand it, Dieleman et al. and Cohen & Welling also use standard convolutions (after a fixed filter / feature map warp), but these papers only consider discrete groups. So it seems like this paper occupies a unique place in the space of equivariant convolutional networks: non-commutative (-), low-dimensional (-), continuous (+) groups, simple (+) and efficient (+) algorithm. Given the proximity though, a more thorough and balanced appraisal of the merits and demerits, as well as the novelty, relative to each of the previous works would be useful. Provided that these issues are cleared up, I would recommend the paper for publication.","The review is overall positive, recommending the paper for publication. However, it does raise several criticisms, mainly around the novelty of the theoretical contributions and the computational analysis.

"There have been numerous works on learning from raw waveforms and training letter-based CTC networks for speech recognition, however, there are very few works on combining both of them with purely ConvNet as it is done in this paper. It is interesting to see results on a large scale corpus such as Librispeech that is used in this paper, though some baseline results from hybrid NN/HMM systems should be provided. To readers, it is unclear how this system is close to state-of-the-art only from Table 2. The key contribution of this paper may be the end-to-end sequence training criterion for their CTC variant (where the blank symbol is dropped), which may be viewed as sequence training of CTC as H. Sak, et al. *Learning acoustic frame labeling for speech recognition with recurrent neural networks*, 2015. However, instead of generating the denominator lattices using a frame-level trained CTC model first, this paper directly compute the sequence-level loss by considering all the competing hypothesis in the normalizer. Therefore, the model is trained end-to-end. From this perspective, it is closely related to D. Povey*s LF-MMI for sequence-training of HMMs. As another reviewer has pointed out, references and discussions on that should be provided. This approach should be more expensive than frame-level training of CTCs, however, from Table 1, the authors* implementation is much faster. Did the systems there use the same sampling rate? You said at the end of 2.2 that the step size for your model is 20ms. Is it also the same for Baidu*s CTC system. Also, have you tried increasing the step size, e.g. to 30ms or 40ms, as people have found that it may work (equally) better, while significantly cut down the computational cost.","The review starts with acknowledging the novelty of the paper's approach in a relatively unexplored area.

"The paper conducts a detailed evaluation of different CNN architectures applied to image retrieval. The authors focus on testing various architectural choices, but do not propose or compare to end-to-end learning frameworks. Technically, the contribution is clear, particularly with the promised clarifications on how multiple scales are handled in the representation. However, I am still not entirely clear whether there would be a difference in the multi-scale settting for full and cropped queries. While the paper focuses on comparing different baseline architectures for CNN-based image retrieval, several recent papers have proposed to learn end-to-end representations specific for this task, with very good result (see for instance the recent work by Gordo et al. *End-to-end Learning of Deep Visual Representations for Image Retrieval*). The authors clarify that their work is orthogonal to papers such as Gordo et al. as they assess instead the performance of networks pre-trained from image classification. In fact, they also indicate that image retrieval is more difficult than image classification -- this is because it is performed by using features originally trained for classification. I can partially accept this argument. However, given the results in recent papers, it is clear than end-to-end training is far superior in practice and it is not clear the analysis developed by the authors in this work would transfer or be useful for that case as well.","The review starts with a relatively neutral tone, acknowledging the technical clarity and contribution of the paper.

"Summary: In this paper, the authors introduce NoiseOut, a way to reduce parameters by pruning neurons from a network. They do this by identifying pairs of neurons produce the most correlated outputs, and replacing the pair by one neuron, and then appropriately adjusting weights. This technique relies on neurons having high correlations however, so they introduce an additional output neuron -- a noise output, which results in the network trying to predict the mean of the noise distribution. As this is a constant, it increases correlation between neurons. Experiments test this out on MNIST and SVHN Comments: This is an interesting suggestion on how to prune neurons, but more experiments (on larger datasets) are probably need to be convincing that this is an approach that is guaranteed to work well. Equation (5) seems to be very straightforwards? It seems like that for larger datasets, more noise outputs might have to be added to ensure higher correlations? Is there a downside to this in terms of the overall accuracy?

"In this paper, the authors explicitly design geometrical structure into a CNN by combining it with a Scattering network. This aids stability and limited-data performance. The paper is well written, the contribution of combining Scattering and CNNs is novel and the results seem promising. I feel that such work was a missing piece in the Scattering literature to make it useful for practical applications. I wish the authors would have investigated the effect of the stable bottom layers with respect to adversarial examples. This can be done in a relatively straightforward way with software like cleverhans [1] or deep fool [2]. It would be very interesting if the first layer*s stability in the hybrid architectures increases robustness significantly, as this would tell us that these fooling images are related to low-level geometry. Finding that this is not the case, would be very interesting as well. Further, the proposed architecture is not evaluated on real limited data problems. This would further strengthen the improved generalization claim. However, I admit that the Cifar-100 / Cifar-10 difference already seems like a promising indicator in this regard. If one of the two points above will be addressed in an additional experiment, I would be happy to raise my score from 6 to 7. Summary: + An interesting approach is presented that might be useful for real-world limited data scenarios. + Limited data results look promising. - Adversarial examples are not investigated in the experimental section. - No realistic small-data problem is addressed.

"This paper proposes new initialization for particular architectures and a correction trick to batch normalization to correct variance introduced by dropout. While authors state interesting observations, the claims are not supported with convincing results. I guess Figure 1 is only for mnist and for only two values of p with one particular network architecture, the dataset and empirical setup is not clear. The convergence is demonstrated only for three dropout values in Figure 2 which may cause an unfair comparison. For instance how does the convergence compare for the best dropout rate after cross-validation (three figures each figure has three results for one method with different dropouts [bests cv result for each one])? Also how is the corresponding validation error and test iterations? Also only mnist does not have to generalize to other benchmarks. Figure 3 gives closer results for Adam optimizer, learning rate is not selected with random search or bayesian optimization, learning decay iterations fixed and regularization coefficient is set to a small value without tuning. A slightly better tuning of parameters may close the current gap. Also Nesterov based competitor gives unreasonably worse accuracy compared to recent results which may indicate that this experiment should not be taken into account. In Table 2, there is no significant improvement on CIFAR10. The CIFAR100 difference is not significant without including batch normalization variance re-estimation. However there is no result for *original with BN update* therefore it is not clear whether the BN update helps in general or not. SVHN also does not have result for original with BN update. There should be baselines with batch normalizations for Figure 1,2 3 to support the claims convincingly. The main criticism about batch normalization is additional computational cost by giving (Mishkin et al, 2016 ) as reference however this should not be a reason to not to compare the initialization to batch-normalization. In fact, (Mishkin et al, 2016) performs comparison to batch normalization and also with and without data augmentation with recent state of art architectures. None of the empirical results have data augmentation. It is not clear if the initialization or batch normalization update will help or make it worse for that case. Recent state of art methods methods like Res Net variant and Dense Net scale to many depths and report result for ImageNet. Although the authors claim that this can be extended to residual network variants, it is not clear if there is going to be any empirical gain for that architectures. This work requires a comprehensive and fair comparison. Otherwise the contribution is not significant.","The review is highly critical of the paper, pointing out numerous flaws in the methodology and results.

No plots with the wall-time of optimization are presented, even though the success of methods like Adagrad was due to their wall-time performance, not the number of iterations. -Why was only a single learning rate learned? To accurately compare against other popular first order methods, why not train a separate RL model for each parameter, similar to how popular first-order methods adaptively change the learning rate for each parameter. -Since learning is a non-stationary process, while RL algorithms assume a stationary environment, why should we expect an RL algorithm to work for learning a learning rate? -In figure 6, how does the proposed method compare to something like early stopping?

"Summary === This paper extends and analyzes the gradient regularizer of Hariharan and Girshick 2016. In that paper a regularizer was proposed which penalizes gradient magnitudes and it was shown to aid low-shot learning performance. This work shows that the previous regularizer is equivalent to a direct penalty on the magnitude of feature values weighted differently per example. The analysis goes to to provide two examples where a feature penalty favors a better representation. The first example addresses the XOR problem, constructing a network where a feature penalty encourages a representation where XOR is linearly separable. The second example analyzes a 2 layer linear network, showing improved stability of a 2nd order optimizer when the feature penalty is added. One last bit of analysis shows how this regularizer can be interpreted as a Gaussian prior on both features and weights. Since the prior can be interpreted as having a soft whitening effect, the feature regularizer is like a soft version of Batch Normalization. Experiments show small improvements on a synthetic XOR test set. On the Omniglot dataset feature regularization is better than most baselines, but is worse than Moment Matching Networks. An experiment on ImageNet similar to Hariharan and Girshick 2016 also shows effective low-shot learning. Strengths === * The core proposal is a simple modification of Hariharan and Girshick 2016. * The idea of feature regularization is analyzed from multiple angles both theoretically and empirically. * The connection with Batch Normalization could have broader impact. Weaknesses === * In section 2 the gradient regularizer of Hariharan and Girshick is introduced. While introducing the concept, some concern is expressed about the motivation: *And it is not very clear why small gradients on every sample produces good generalization experimentally.* This seems to be the central issue to me. The paper details some related analysis, it does not offer a clear answer to this problem. * The purpose and generality of section 2.1 is not clear. The analysis provides a specific case (XOR with a non-standard architecture) where feature regularization intuitively helps learn a better representation. However, the intended take-away is not clear. The take-away may be that since a feature penalty helps in this case it should help in other cases. I am hesitant to buy that argument because of the specific architecture used in this section. The result seems to rely on the choice of an x^2 non-linearity, which is not often encountered in recent neural net literature. The point might also be to highlight the difference between a weight penalty and a feature penalty because the two seem to encourage different values of b in this case. However, there is no comparison to a weight penalty on b in section 2.1. * As far as I can tell, eq. 3 depends on either assuming an L2 or cross-entropy loss. A more general class of losses for which eq. 3 holds is not provided. This should be made clear before eq. 3 is presented. * The Omniglot and ImageNet experiments are performed with Batch Normalization, yet the paper points out that feature regularization may be similar in effect to Batch Norm. Since the ResNet CNN baseline includes Batch Norm and there are clear improvements over that baseline, the proposed regularizer has a clear additional positive effect. However, results should be provided without Batch Norm so a 1-1 comparison between the two methods can be performed. * The ImageNet experiment should be more like Hariharan and Girshick. In particular, the same split of classes should be used (provided in the appendix) and performance should be measured using n > 1 novel examples per class (using k nearest neighbors). Minor: * A brief comparison to Matching Networks is provided in section 3.2, but the performance of Matching Networks should also be reported in Table 1. * From the approach section: *Intuitively when close to convergence, about half of the data-cases recommend to update a parameter to go left, while the other half recommend to go right.* Could the intuition be clarified? There are many directions in high dimensional space and many ways to divide them into two groups. * Is the SGM penalty of Hariharan and Girshick implemented for this paper or using their code? Either is acceptable, but clarification would be appreciated. * Should the first equal sign in eq. 13 be proportional to, not equal to? * The work is dense in nature, but I think the presentation could be improved. In particular, more detailed derivations could be provided in an appendix and some details could be removed from the main version in order to increase focus on the results (e.g., the derviation in section 2.2.1). Overall Evaluation === This paper provides an interesting set of analyses, but their value is not clear. There is no clear reason why a gradient or feature regularizer should improve low-shot learning performance. Despite that, experiments support that conclusion, the analysis is interesting by itself, and the analysis may help lead to a clearer explanation. The work is a somewhat novel extension and analysis of Hariharan and Girshick 2016. Some points are not completely clear, as mentioned above.","The review is mostly positive, highlighting the strengths of the paper such as its novel analysis and interesting findings.

"The problem of utilizing all available information (across modalities) about a product to learn a meaningful *joint* embedding is an interesting one, and certainly seems like it a promising direction for improving recommender systems, especially in the *cold start* scenario. I*m unaware of approaches combining as many modalities as proposed in this paper, so an effective solution could indeed be significant. However, there are many aspects of the proposed architecture that seem sub-optimal to me: 1. A major benefit of neural-network based systems is that the entire system can be trained end-to-end, jointly. The proposed approach sticks together largely pre-trained modules for different modalities... this can be justifiable when there is very little training data available on which to train jointly. With 10M product pairs, however, this doesn*t seem to be the case for the Amazon dataset (although I haven*t worked with this dataset myself so perhaps I*m missing something... either way it*s not discussed at all in the paper). I consider the lack of a jointly fine-tuned model a major shortcoming of the proposed approach. 2. The discussion of *pairwise residual units* is confusing and not well-motivated. The residual formulation (if I understand it correctly) applies a ReLU layer to the concatenation of the modality specific embeddings, giving a new similarity (after dot products) that can be added to the similarity obtained from the concatenation directly. Why not just have an additional fully-connected layer that mixes the modality specific embeddings to form a final embedding (perhaps of lower dimensionality)? This should at least be presented as a baseline, if the pairwise residual unit is claimed as a contribution... I don*t find the provided explanation convincing (in what way does the residual approach reduce parameter count?). 3. More minor: The choice of TextCNN for the text embedding vectors seems fine (although I wonder how an LSTM-based approach would perform)... However the details surrounding how it is used are obscured in the paper. In response to a question, the authors mention that it runs on the concatenation of the first 10 words of the title and product description. Especially for the description, this seems insufficiently long to contain a lot of information to me. More care could be given to motivating the choices made in the paper. Finally, I*m not familiar with state of the art on this dataset... do the comparisons accurately reflect it? It seems only one competing technique is presented, with none on the more challenging cold-start scenarios.

"A method for click prediction is presented. Inputs are a categorical variables and output is the click-through-rate. The categorical input data is embedded into a feature vector using a discriminative scheme that tries to predict whether a sample is fake or not. The embedding vector is passed through a series of SUM/MULT gates and K-most important interactions are identified (K-max pooling). This process is repeated multiple times (i.e. multiple layers) and the final feature is passed into a fully connected layer to output the click prediction rate. Authors claim: (1) Use of gates and K-max pooling allow modeling of interactions that lead to state of art results. (2) It is not straightforward to apply ideas in papers like word2vec to obtain feature embeddings and consequently they use the idea of discriminating between fake and true samples for feature learning. Theoretically convolutions can act as “sum” gates between pairs of input dimensions. Authors make these interactions explicit (i.e. imposed structure) by using gates. Now, the merit of the proposed method can be tested if a network using gates outperforms a network without gates. This baseline is critically missing – i.e. Embedding Vector followed by a series of convolution/pooling layers. Another related issue is that I am not sure if the number of parameters in the proposed model and the baseline models is similar or not. For instance – what is the total number of parameters in the CCPM model v/s the proposed model? Overall, there is no new idea in the paper. This by itself is not grounds for rejection if the paper outperforms established baselines. However, such comparison is weak and I encourage authors to perform these comparisons.","The reviewer acknowledges the claims made in the paper but points out significant flaws in the evaluation.

"Game of tic-tac-toe is considered. 1029 tic-tac-toe board combinations are chosen so that a single move will result into victory of either the black or the white player. There are 18 possible moves - 2 players x 9 locations. A CNN is trained from a visual rendering of the game board to these 18 possible outputs. CAM technique is used to visualize the salient regions in the inputs responsible for the prediction that CNN makes. Authors find that predictions correspond to the winning board locations. Authors claim that this: 1. is a very interesting finding. 2. CNN has figured out game rules. 3. Cross modal supervision is applicable to higher-level semantics. I don*t think (2) be can be claimed because the knowledge of game rules is not tested by any experiment. There is only *one* stage of a game - i.e. last move that is considered. Further, the results are on the training set itself - the bare minimum requirement of any implicit or explicit representation of game rules is the ability to act in previously unseen states (i.e. generalization). Even if the CNN did generalize, I would avoid making any claims about knowledge of game rules. For (3), author*s definition of cross-modal seems to be training from images to games moves. In image-classification we go from images --> labels (i.e. between two different domains). We already know CNNs can perform such mappings. CNNs have been used to map images to actions such as in DQN my Mnih et al., or DDPG by Lillicrap et al. and a lot of other classical work such as ALVIN. It*s unclear what points authors are trying to make. For (1): how interesting is an implicit attention mechanism is a subjective matter. The authors claim a difference between the concepts of *what do do* and *what will happen*. They claim by supervising for *what will happen*, the CNN can automatically learn about *what to do*. This is extensively studied in the model predictive control literature. Where model is *what will happen next*, and the model is used to infer a control law - *what to do*. However, in the experimental setup presented in the paper what will happen and what to do seem to be the exact same things. For further analysis of what the CNN has learnt I would recommend: (a) Visualizing CAM with respect to incorrect classes. For eg, visualize the CAM with respect to player would lose (instead of winning). (b) Split the data into train/val and use the predictions on the val-set for visualization. These would be much more informative about what kind of *generalizable* features the CNN pays attention to. In summary, understanding why CNN*s make what decisions they make is a very interesting area of research. While the emergence of an implicit attention mechanism may be considered to be an interesting finding by some, many claims made by the authors are not supported by experiments (see comments above).","The reviewer finds the research topic interesting but is critical of the authors' claims and experimental setup. They disagree with several conclusions drawn, particularly regarding the CNN understanding game rules and the novelty of the cross-modal approach.

"This paper proposes a simple randomized algorithm for selecting which weights in a ConvNet to prune in order to reduce theoretical FLOPs when evaluating a deep neural network. The paper provides a nice taxonomy or pruning granularity from coarse (layer-wise) to fine (intra-kernel). The pruning strategy is empirically driven and uses a validation set to select the best model from N randomly pruned models. Makes claims in the intro about this being *one shot* and *near optimal* that cannot be supported: it is *N-shot* in the sense that N networks are generated and tested and there is no evidence or theory that the found solution is *near optimal.* Pros: - Nice taxonomy of pruning levels - Comparison to the recent weight-sum pruning method Cons: - Experimental evaluation does not touch upon recent models (ResNets) and large scale datasets (ImageNet) - Paper is somewhat hard to follow - Feature map pruning can obviously accelerate computation without specialized sparse implementations of convolution, but this is not the case for finer grained sparsity; since this paper considers fine-grained sparsity it should provide some evidence that introducing that sparsity can yield performance improvements Another experimental downside is that the paper does not evaluate the impact of filter pruning on transfer learning. For example, there is not much direct interest in the tasks of MNIST, CIFAR10, or even ImageNet. Instead, a main interest in both academia and industry is the value of the learned representation for transferring to other tasks. One might expect pruning to harm transfer learning. It*s possible that the while the main task has about the same performance, transfer learning is strongly hurt. This paper has missed an opportunity to explore that direction. In summary, the proposed method is simple, which is good, but the experimental evaluation is somewhat incomplete and does not cover recent models and larger scale datasets.","The review acknowledges some positive aspects of the paper, such as the ""nice taxonomy of pruning levels"" and the simplicity of the proposed method.

"Description: This paper presents a reinforcement learning architecture where, based on *natural-language* input, a meta-controller chooses subtasks and communicates them to a subtask controller that choose primitive actions, based on the communicated subtask. The goal is to scale up reinforcement learning agents to large-scale tasks. The subtask controller embeds the subtask definition (arguments) into vectors by a multi-layer perceptron including an *analogy-making* regularization. The subtask vectors are combined with inputs at each layer of a CNN. CNN outputs (given the observation and the subtask) are then fed to one of two MLPs; one to compute action probabilities in the policy (exponential falloff of MLP outputs) and the other to compute termination probability (sigmoid from MLP outputs). The meta controller takes a list of sentences as instructions embeds them into a sequence of subtask arguments (not necessarily a one-to-one mapping). A context vector is computed by a CNN from the observation, the previous sentence embedding, the previous subtask and its completion state. The subtask arguments are computed from the context vector through further mechanisms involving instruction retrieval from memory pointers, and hard/soft decisions whether to update the subtask or not. Training involves policy distillation+actor-critic training for the subtask controller, and actor-critic training for the meta controller keeping the subtask controller frozen. The system is tested in a grid world where the agent moves and interacts with (picks up/transforms) various item/enemy types. It is compared to a) a flat controller not using a subtask controller, and b) subtask control by mere concatenation of the subtask embedding to the input with/without the analogy-making regularization. Evaluation: The proposed architecture seems reasonable, although it is not clear why the specific way of combining subtask embeddings in the subtask controller would be the *right* way to do it. I do not feel the grid world here really represents a *large-scale task*: in particular the 10x10 size of the grid is very small. This is disappointing since this was a main motivation of the work. Moreover, the method is not compared to any state of the art alternatives. This is especially problematic because the test is not on established benchmarks. It is not really possible, based on the shown results, to put the performance in context of other works.","The review is mostly neutral, with a slightly positive leaning due to the use of ""reasonable"" and ""interesting"".

"Update: I thank the authors for their comments! After reading them, I decided to increase the rating. This paper proposes a variant of the convolution operation suitable for a broad class of graph structures. For each node in the graph, a set of neighbours is devised by means of random walk (the neighbours are ordered by the expected number of visits). As a result, the graph is transformed into a feature matrix resembling MATLAB’s/Caffe’s im2col output. The convolution itself becomes a matrix multiplication. Although the proposed convolution variant seems reasonable, I’m not convinced by the empirical evaluation. The MNIST experiment looks especially suspicious. I don’t think that this dataset is appropriate for the demonstration purposes in this case. In order to make their method applicable to the data, the authors remove important structural information (relative locations of pixels) thus artificially increasing the difficulty of the task. At the same time, they are comparing their approach with regular CNNs and conclude that the former performs poorly (and does not even reach an acceptable accuracy for the particular dataset). I guess, to justify the presence of MNIST (or similar datasets) in the experimental section, the authors should modify their method to incorporate additional graph structure (e.g. relative locations of nodes) in cases when the relation between nodes cannot be fully described by a similarity matrix. I believe, in its current form, the paper is not yet ready for publication but may be later resubmitted to a workshop or another conference after the concern above is addressed.","The review starts with a positive note, acknowledging the novelty of the proposed method.

"* Summary: This paper proposes a neural machine translation model that translates the source and the target texts in an end to end manner from characters to characters. The model can learn morphology in the encoder and in the decoder the authors use a hierarchical decoder.

The paper is well-written, the results are competitive compared to other baselines in the literature. * Review: - I think the paper is very well written, I like the analysis presented in this paper. It is clean and precise. - The idea of using hierarchical decoders have been explored before, e.g. [1]. Can you cite those papers? - This paper is mainly an application paper and it is mainly the application of several existing components on the character-level NMT tasks. In this sense, it is good that authors made their codes available online. However, the contributions from the general ML point of view is still limited. * Some Requests: -Can you add the size of the models to the Table 1? - Can you add some of the failure cases of your model, where the model failed to translate correctly? * An Overview of the Review: Pros: - The paper is well written - Extensive analysis of the model on various language pairs - Convincing experimental results. Cons: - The model is complicated. - Mainly an architecture engineering/application paper(bringing together various well-known techniques), not much novelty. - The proposed model is potentially slower than the regular models since it needs to operate over the characters instead of the words and uses several RNNs.

"The paper presents a simple method for constructing a visual hierarchy of ImageNet classes based on a CNN trained on discriminate between the classes. It investigates two metrics for measuring inter-class similarity: (1) softmax probability outputs, i.e., the class confusion matrix, and (2) L2 distance between fc7 features, along with three methods for constructing the hierarchy given the distance matrix: (1) approximation central point, (2) minimal spanning tree, and (3) multidimensional scaling of Borg&Groenen 2005. There are two claimed contributions: (1) Constructs a biology evolutionary tree, and (2) Gives insight into the representations produced by deep networks. Regarding (1), while the motivation of the work is grounded in biology, in practice the method is based only on visual similarity. The constructed trees thus can’t be expected to reflect the evolutionary hierarchy, and in fact there are no quantitative experiments that demonstrate that they do. Regarding (2), the technical depth of the exploration is not sufficient for ICLR. I’m not sure what we can conclude from the paper beyond the fact that CNNs are able to group categories together based on visual similarities, and deeper networks are able to do this better than more shallow networks (Fig 2).

"This work proposes to use basic probability assignment to improve deep transfer learning. A particular re-weighting scheme inspired by Dempster-Shaffer and exploiting the confusion matrix of the source task is introduced.

There are many typos, and the presentation is not clear. For example, the way the training set for weak classifiers are constructed remains unclear to me despite the author*s previous answer.

"This paper investigates the hessian of small deep networks near the end of training. The main result is that many eigenvalues are approximately zero, such that the Hessian is highly singular, which means that a wide amount of theory does not apply. The overall point that deep learning algorithms are singular, and that this undercuts many theoretical results, is important but it has already been made: Watanabe. “Almost All Learning Machines are Singular”, FOCI 2007. This is one paper in a growing body of work investigating this phenomenon. In general, the references for this paper could be fleshed out much further—a variety of prior work has examined the Hessian in deep learning, e.g., Dauphin et al. “Identifying and attacking the saddle point problem in high dimensional non-convex optimization” NIPS 2014 or the work of Amari and others. Experimentally, it is hard to tell how results from the small sized networks considered here might translate to much larger networks. It seems likely that the behavior for much larger networks would be different. A reason for optimism, though, is the fact that a clear bulk/outlier behavior emerges even in these networks. Characterizing this behavior for simple systems is valuable. Overall, the results feel preliminary but likely to be of interest when further fleshed out. This paper is attacking an important problem, but should do a better job situating itself in the related literature and undertaking experiments of sufficient size to reveal large-scale behavior relevant to practice.","The review acknowledges the importance of the paper's topic and findings (""The overall point...is important"") but raises concerns about its novelty and limited experimental scope.

"The paper aims to consolidate some recent literature in simple types of *reading comprehension* tasks involving matching questions to answers to be found in a passage, and then to explore the types of structure learned by these models and propose modifications. These reading comprehension datasets such as CNN/Daily Mail are on the simpler side because they do not generally involve chains of reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence as can be found in datasets like MCTest. Many models have been proposed for this task, and the paper breaks down these models into *aggregation readers* and *explicit reference readers.* The authors show that the aggregation readers organize their hidden states into a predicate structure which allows them to mimic the explicit reference readers. The authors then experiment with adding linguistic features, including reference features, to the existing models to improve performance. I appreciate the re-naming and re-writing of the paper to make it more clear that the aggregation readers are specifically learning a predicate structure, as well as the inclusion of results about dimensionality of the symbol space. Further, I think the effort to organize and categorize several different reading comprehension models into broader classes is useful, as the field has been producing many such models and the landscape is unclear. The concerns with this paper are that the predicate structure demonstrated is fairly simple, and it is not clear that it provides insight towards the development of better models in the future, since the *explicit reference readers* need not learn it, and the CNN/Daily Mail dataset has very little headroom left as demonstrated by Chen et al. 2016. The desire for *dramatic improvements in performance* mentioned in the discussion section probably cannot be achieved on these datasets. More complex datasets would probably involve multi-hop inference which this paper does not discuss. Further, the message of the paper is a bit scattered and hard to parse, and could benefit from a bit more focus. I think that with the explosion of various competing neural network models for NLP tasks, contributions like this one which attempt to organize and analyze the landscape are valuable, but that this paper might be better suited for an NLP conference or journal such as TACL.","The reviewer provides a balanced perspective, acknowledging the paper's strengths in organizing and analyzing reading comprehension models but also pointing out its limitations.

"SYNOPSIS: The paper proposes a new neural network-based model for reading comprehension (reading a passage of text and answering questions based on the passage). It is similar in spirit to several other recent models, with the main exception that it is able to predict answers of different lengths, as opposed to single words/tokens/entities. The authors compare their model on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), and show improvements over the baselines, while apparently lagging quite far behind the current state of the art reported on the SQuAD leaderboard. THOUGHTS: The main novelty of the method is to be able to identify phrases of different lengths as possible answers to the question. However, both approaches considered -- using a POS pattern trie tree to filter out word sequences with POS tags matching those of answers in the training set, and brute-force enumeration of all phrases up to length N -- seem somewhat orthogonal to the idea of *learning end-to-end * an answer chunk extraction model. Furthermore, as other reviews have pointed out, it seems that the linguistic features actually contribute a lot to the final accuracy (Table 3). One could argue that these are easy to obtain using standard taggers, but it takes away even more from the idea of an *end-to-end trained* system. The paper is generally well written, but there are several crucial sections in parts describing the model where it was really hard for me to follow the descriptions. In particular, the attention mechanism seems fairly standard to me in a seq2seq sense (i.e. there is nothing architecturally novel about it, as is for instance the case with the Gated Attentive Reader). I may be missing something, but even after the clarification round I still don*t understand how it is novel compared to standard attention used in for instance seq2seq models. Finally, although the method is shown to outperform the baseline method reported in the original paper introducing the SQuAD dataset, it currently seems to be 12th (out of 15 systems) on the leaderboard (https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/). Of course, it may be that further training and hyperparameter optimizations may improve these results. Therefore, given the lack of model novelty (based on my understanding), and the lack of strong results (based on the leaderboard), I don*t feel the paper is ready in its current form to be accepted to the conference. Note: The GRU citation should be (Cho et al., 2014), not (Bengio et al., 2015).","The reviewer acknowledges the paper is well-written but identifies a lack of novelty in the model and points out its weak performance compared to the state-of-the-art.

"Summary: This paper presents a differentiable histogram filter for state estimation/tracking. The proposed histogram filter is a particular Bayesian filter that represents the discretized states using beliefs. The prediction step is parameterized by a locally linear and translation-invariant motion model while the measurement model is represented by a multi-layered neural network. The whole system is learned with both supervised and unsupervised objectives and experiments are carried out on two synthetic robot localization tasks (1D and 2D). The major claim of this paper is that the problem-specific model structure (Bayesian filter for state estimation) should improve pure deep learning approach in data-efficiency and generalization ability. +This paper has nice arguments about the importance of prior knowledge to deep learning approach for specific tasks. +An end-to-end histogram filter is derived for state estimation and unsupervised learning is possible in this model. -This paper seems to have a hidden assumption that deep learning (RNN) is a natural choice for recursive state estimation and the rest of paper is built upon this assumption including LSTM baselines. However, this assumption itself may not be true, because Bayesian filter is a first-established approach for this classic problem, so it it more important to justify if deep learning is even necessary for solving the tasks presented. This requests pure Bayesian filter baselines in the experiments. -The derived histogram filter seems to be particularly designed for discretized state space. It is not clear how well it can be generalized to continuous state space using the notation *x*. More interestingly, the observation is discrete (binary) as well, which eventually makes it possible to derive a closed-form measurement update model. This setup might be too constrained. Generalizing to continuous observations is not a trivial task, not even to mention using images as observations like Haarnoja et al 2016. These design choices overall narrow down the scope of applicability.","The review starts with positive sentiment, highlighting the nice arguments and end-to-end learning.

"This paper is refreshing and elegant in its handling of *over-sampling* in VAE. Problem is that good reconstruction requires more nodes in the latent layers of the VAE. Not all of them can or should be sampled from at the *creative* regime of the VAE. Which ones to choose? The paper offers and sensible solution. Problem is that real-life data-sets like CIFAR have not being tried, so the reader is hard-pressed to choose between many other, just as natural, solutions.

"This paper aims to characterize the perceptual ability of a neural network under different input conditions. This is done by manipulating the input image x in various ways (e.g. downsamplig, foveating), and training an auto-encoder to reconstruct the original full-resolution image. MSE and qualitative results are shown and compared for the different input conditions. Unfortunately, this paper seems to lack focus, presenting a set of preliminary inspections with few concrete conclusions. For example, at the end of sec 4.4, *This result is not surprising, given that FOV-R contains additional information .... These results suggests that a small number of foveations containing rich details might be all these neural networks need....*. But this hypothesis is left dangling: What detailed regions are needed, and from where? For what sort of tasks? Secondly, it isn*t clear to me what reconstruction behaviors are caused by a fundamental perception of the input, and what are artifacts of the autoencoder and pixelwise l2 loss? A prime example is texture, which the autoencoder fails to recover. But with a pixelwise loss, the network must predict high-frequency textures nearly pixel-for-pixel at training time; if this is impossible, then it will generate a pixelwise average of the training samples --- a flat region. So then the network*s inability to reconstruct textures is due to a problem generating them, specifically averaging from the training loss, not necessarily an issue in perceiving textures. A network trained a different way (perhaps an adversarial network) may infer a texture is there, even if it wouldn*t be able to generate it in a pixelwise l2 sense. Similarly, the ability to perform color reconstruction given a color glimpse I think has much to do with disambiguating the color of an object/scene: If there is an ambiguity, the network won*t know which to *choose* (white flower or yellow flower?) and output an average, which is why there are so many sepia tones. However, in its section on this, the paper only measures the reconstruction error for different amounts of color given, and does not drill very far into any hypotheses for why this behavior occurs. There are some interesting measurements here, such as the amount of color needed in the foveation to reconstruct a color image, and the discussion on global features, which may start to get at a mechanism by which glimpses may propagate to an entire reconstruction. But overall it*s hard to know what to take away from this paper. What are larger concrete conclusions that can be garnered from the details, and what mechanisms bring them about? Can these be more thoroughly explored with more focus?","The reviewer acknowledges some interesting measurements and discussions but ultimately finds the paper lacking focus and concrete conclusions.

The model is trained on the big artificial dataset and tested on the small target datasets (section 4.1) 2. The model is pre-trained on the big artificial dataset like before, then fine-tuned on a few examples from the target dataset and tested on the remaining target examples. Several such models are trained using different sub-sets of fine-tuning examples. The results are tested against the performance of randomly intialized then fine-tuned models (section 4.2). 3. The model is pre-trained on the big artificial dataset like before. The model is made of an embedding component and an encoder component. Alternatively, each component is reset to a random initialization, to test the importance of the pre-training in each component. Then the model is fine-tuned on a few examples from the target dataset and tested on the remaining target examples. (section 4.3) I think what makes things difficult to follow is the fact that the test set is composed by several sub tasks, and sometimes what is reported is the mean performance across the tasks, sometimes the performance on a few tasks. Sometimes what we see is the mean performance of several models? You should report standard deviations also. Could you better explain what you mean by best validation ? Interesting and unpretentious work. The clarity of the presentation could be improved maybe by simplifying the experimental setup? The interesting conclusion I think is reported at the end of the section 4.1, when the nuanced difference between the datasets are exposed. Minor: unexplained acronyms: GRU, BT, CBT. benfits p. 2 subsubset p. 6","The reviewer acknowledges the work as ""interesting"" and ""unpretentious"", suggesting a generally positive view.

"The paper proposes the group sparse autoencoder that enforces sparsity of the hidden representation group-wise, where the group is formed based on labels (i.e., supervision). The p-th group hidden representation is used for reconstruction with group sparsity penalty, allowing learning more discriminative, class-specific patterns in the dataset. The paper also propose to combine both group-level and individual level sparsity as in Equation (9). Clarity of the paper is a bit low. - Do you use only p-th group*s activation for reconstruction? If it is true, then for Equation (9) do you use all individual hidden representation for reconstruction or still using the subset of representation corresponding to that class only? - In Equation (7), RHS misses the summation over p, and wondering it is a simple typo. - Is the algorithm end-to-end trainable? It seems to me that the group sparse CNN is no more than the GSA whose input data is the feature extracted from sequential CNNs (or any other pretrained CNNs). Other comments are as follows: - Furthermore the group sparse autoencoder is (semi-) supervised method since it uses label information to form a group, whereas the standard sparse autoencoder is fully unsupervised. That being said, it is not surprising that group sparse autoencoder learns more class-specific pattern whereas sparse autoencoder doesn*t. I think the fair comparison should be to autoencoders that combines classification for their objective function. - Although authors claim that GSA learns more group-relevant features, Figure 3 (b) is not convincing enough to support this claim. For example, the first row contains many filters that doesn*t look like 1 (e.g., very last column looks like 3). - Other than visual inspection, do you observe improvement in classification using proposed algorithm on MNIST experiments? - The comparison to the baseline model is missing. I believe the baseline model shouldn*t be the sequential CNN, but the sequential CNN + sparse autoencoder. In addition, more control experiment is required that compares between the Equation (7)-(9), with different values of alpha and eta. Missing reference: Shang et al., Discriminative Training of Structured Dictionaries via Block Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, SDM 2016 - they consider block orthgonal matching pursuit for dictionary learning whose blocks (i.e., projection matrices) are constructed based on the class labels for discirminative training.","The review starts with a neutral statement, summarizing the paper's proposal.

"The paper proposed a very complex compression and reconstruction method (with additional parameters) for reducing the memory footprint of deep networks. The authors show that this complex proposal is better than simple hashed net proposal. One question: Are you also counting the extra parameters for reconstruction network for the memory comparison? Otherwise, the experiments are unfair. Since hashing and reconstruction cost will dominate the feed-forward and back-propagation updates, it is imperative to compare the two methods on running time. For hashed net, this is quite simple, yet it created an additional bottleneck. Please also show the impact on running time. Small improvements for a big loss in computational cost may not be acceptable. I am not convinced that this method will be lightweight. If we are allowed complicated compression and reconstruction then we can use any off-shelf methods, but the cost will be huge","The reviewer expresses skepticism and doubt about the proposed method's efficiency. They point out a potential flaw in the experimental comparison ('unfair') and demand further experiments regarding running time. The phrase 'I am not convinced' indicates a negative sentiment.

"The paper tests various feedforward network architectures for supervised training to predict a human’s next move, given a board position. It trains on human play data taken from KGX, augmenting the data by considering all 8 rotations/reflections of each board position. The paper’s presentation is inefficient and muddled, and the results seem incremental. Presentation: The abstract and introduction point out that AlphaGo requires many RL iterations to train, and propose to improve this by swapping out the policy network with one that is more amenable to training. However, the paper only presents supervised learning results, not RL. While it’s not unreasonable to assume that a higher-capacity network that shows improvements in supervised learning will also yield dividends in RL, it’s still unsatisfying to be presented with SL improvements and be asked to assume that the RL improvements will be of a similar magnitude, whatever that may mean. It would’ve been more convincing to train both AlphaGo and this paper*s architectures on an equal number of RL self-play iterations, then have them play each other. (Both would be pre-trained using supervised training, as per the AlphaGo paper). It is not until section 3.3 that it is clearly stated this is strictly a supervised-learning paper. This should have been put front and center in the abstract and introduction. Fully 3 pages are spent on giant but simple architecture diagrams. This is both extravagant and muddles the exposition. It seems better to show just the architectures used in the experiments, and spend at most half a page doing so, so that they may be seen alongside one another. The results (Table 1, Figures 7 and 8) are hard to skim, as there is little information in the captions, and the graph axes are poorly labeled. For example, I assume “Examples” in figures 7 and 8 should be “Training examples”, and the number of training examples isn’t 0-50, but some large multiple thereof. Results: The take-home seems to be that that deeper networks do better, and residual architectures and spatial batch normalization each improve the results in this domain, as they are known to do in others. Furthermore, we are asked to assume that the improvements in an RL setting will be similar to the improvements in SL shown here. These results seem too incremental to justify an ICLR publication.","The review is critical of the paper's presentation, clarity, and significance of results. It points out missing information, inefficient use of space, and questions the validity of extrapolating supervised learning improvements to reinforcement learning. While the reviewer doesn't resort to personal attacks or overly negative language, the tone is quite critical and suggests the paper needs significant revisions. ",-50,50
"This paper empirically studies the invariance, equivariance and equivalence properties of representations learned by convolutional networks under various kinds of data augmentation. Additional loss terms are presented which can make a representation more invariant or equivariant. The idea of measuring invariance, equivariance and equivalence of representations is not new (Lenc & Vedaldi). The authors are the first to systematically study the effect of data augmentation on these properties, but it is unclear in what way the results are surprising, interesting, or useful. It is not really surprising that data augmentation increases invariance, or that training with the same augmentation leads to more similar representations than training with different augmentations. Regarding the presented method to increase invariance and equivariance: while it could be that a representation will generalize better if it is invariant or equivariant, it is not clear why one would want to increase in/equivariance if it does not indeed lead to improvements in performance. The paper presents no evidence that training for increased invariance / equivariance leads to substantial improvements in performance. Combined with the fact that the loss (eq. 6) would substantially increase the computational burden, I don’t think this technique will be very useful. Minor comments: -R^{nxn} should be R^{n 	imes n} -In eq. 2: ‘equivaraince’ -In 3.3, argmax is not properly formatted -I think data augmentation was already considered essential before Krizhevsky et al. Not really correct to attribute this to them. - About the claim “This is related to the idea of whether CNNs collapse (invariance) or linearize (equivariance) view manifolds of 3D objects”. The idea that equivariance means that the manifold (orbit) is linearized, is incorrect. A linear representation M_g can create nonlinear manifolds. A simple example is given by a rotation matrix in 2D (clearly linear), generating a nonlinear manifold (the circle). - Equivariance in eq. 2 should be called “non-equivariance”. If the value is low, the representation is equivariant, while if it is high it is non-equivariant. - “Eq. 2 also uses the paradigm that”, uses the word paradigm in a strange manner - In the definition of x’_ij, should one of the g_j be inverted? Otherwise it seems like the transformation is applied twice, instead of being undone.","The review is critical of the paper's novelty and usefulness. While acknowledging the systematic study of data augmentation effects, the reviewer finds the results unsurprising and questions the practicality of the proposed method due to its computational burden and lack of performance improvement evidence.

This paper theoretically justified a faster convergence (in terms of average gradient norm attained after processing a fixed number of samples) of using small mini-batches for SGD or ASGD with smaller number of learners. This indicates that there is an inherent inefficiency in the speed-up obtained with parallelizing gradient descent methods by taking advantage of hardware. This paper looks good overall and makes some connection between algorithm design and hardware properties. My main concern is that Lemma 1 looks incorrect to me. The factor D_f / S should be D_f/ (S*M) for me. Please clarify this and check the subsequent theorem.,"The review starts with positive statements, highlighting the paper's contribution and overall quality. While it points out a concern about a potential error, the reviewer does so constructively and maintains a professional tone. The language used is polite and objective.",60,80
"The paper claims improved inference for density estimation of sparse data (here text documents) using deep generative Gaussian models (variational auto-encoders), and a method for deriving word embeddings from the model*s generative parameters that allows for a degree of interpretability similar to that of Bayesian generative topic models. To discuss the contributions I will quickly review the generative story in the paper: first a K-dimensional latent representation is sampled from a multivariate Gaussian, then an MLP (with parameters 	heta) predicts unnormalised potentials over a vocabulary of V words, the potentials are exponentiated and normalised to make the parameters of a multinomial from where word observations are repeatedly sampled to make a document. Here intractable inference is replaced by the VAE formulation where an inference network (with parameters phi) independently predicts for each document the mean and variance of a normal distribution (amenable to reparameterised gradient computation). The first, and rather trivial, contribution is to use tf-idf features to inject first order statistics (a global information) into local observations. The authors claim that this is particularly helpful in the case of sparse data such as text. The second contribution is more interesting. In optimising generative parameters (	heta) and variational parameters (phi), the authors turn to a treatment which is reminiscent of the original SVI procedure. That is, they see the variational parameters phi as *global* variational parameters, and the predicted mean mu(x) and covariance Sigma(x) of each observation x are treated as *local* variational parameters. In the original VAE, local parameters are not directly optimised, instead they are indirectly optimised via optimisation of the global parameters utilised in their prediction (shared MLP parameters). Here, local parameters are optimised holding generative parameters fixed (line 3 of Algorithm 1). The optimised local parameters are then used in the gradient step of the generative parameters (line 4 of Algorithm 1). Finally, global variational parameters are also updated (line 5). Whereas indeed other authors have proposed to optimise local parameters, I think that deriving this procedure from the more familiar SVI makes the contribution less of a trick and easier to relate to. Some things aren*t entirely clear to me. I think it would have been nice if the authors had shown the functional form of the gradient used in step 3 of Algorithm 1. The gradient step for global variational parameters (line 5 of Algorithm 1) uses the very first prediction of local parameters (thus ignoring the optimisation in step 3), this is unclear to me. Perhaps I am missing a fundamental reason why that has to be the case (either way, please clarify). The authors argue that this optimisation turns out helpful to modelling sparse data because there is evidence that the generative model p_	heta(x|z) suffers from poor initialisation. Please, discuss why you expect the initialisation problem to be worse in the case of sparse data. The final contribution is a neat procedure to derive word embeddings from the generative model parameters. These embeddings are then used to interpret what the model has learnt. Interestingly, these word embeddings are context-sensitive once that the latent variable models an entire document. About Figures 2a and 2b: the caption says that solid lines indicate validation perplexity for M=1 (no optimisation of local parameters) and dashed lines indicate M=100 (100 iterations of optimisation of local parameters), but the legends of the figures suggest a different reading. If I interpret the figures based on the caption, then it seems that indeed deeper networks exposed to more data benefit from optimisation of local parameters. Are the authors pretty sure that in Figure 2b models with M=1 have reached a plateau (so that longer training would not allow them to catch up with M=100 curves)? As the authors explain in the caption, x-axis is not comparable on running time, thus the question. The analysis of singular values seems like an interesting way to investigate how the model is using its capacity. However, I can barely interpret Figures 2c and 2d, I think the authors could have walked readers through them. As for the word embedding I am missing an evaluation on a predictive task. Also, while illustrative, Table 2b is barely reproducible. The text reads *we create a document comprising a subset of words in the the context’s Wikipedia page.* which is rather vague. I wonder whether this construct needs to be carefully designed in order to get Table 2b. In sum, I have a feeling that the inference technique and the embedding technique are both useful, but perhaps they should have been presented separately so that each could have been explored in greater depth.","The review is quite detailed and provides both positive feedback (e.g., ""interesting contribution"", ""neat procedure"") and constructive criticism.

"The paper proposes to perform active learning using pool selection of deep learning mini-batches using an approximation of the bayesian posterior. Several terms are in turn approximated. The Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) bayesian inference approach to active learning, the various approximations, and more generally the theoretical framework is very interesting but difficult to follow. The paper is written in poor English and is sometimes a bit painful to read. Alternative Active learning strategies and techniques do not need to be described with such detail. On the other hand, the proposed approach has a lot of complex approximations which would benefit from a more detailed/structured presentation.

"The paper proposes a new second-order method L-SR1 to train deep neural networks. It is claimed that the method addresses two important optimization problems in this setting: poor conditioning of the Hessian and proliferation of saddle points. The method can be viewed as a concatenation of SR1 algorithm of Nocedal & Wright (2006) and limited-memory representations Byrd et al. (1994). First of all, I am missing a more formal, theoretical argument in this work (in general providing more intuition would be helpful too), which instead is provided in the works of Dauphin (2014) or Martens. The experimental section in not very convincing considering that the performance in terms of the wall-clock time is not reported and the advantage over some competitor methods is not very strong even in terms of epochs. I understand that the authors are optimizing their implementation still, but the question is: considering the experiments are not convincing, why would anybody bother to implement L-SR1 to train their deep models?

"A method for training neural networks to mimic abstract data structures is presented. The idea of training a network to satisfy an abstract interface is very interesting and promising, but empirical support is currently too weak.

"This paper investigates deep generative models with multiple stochastic nodes and gives them meaning by semi-supervision. From a methodological point of view, there is nothing fundamentally novel (it is very similar to the semi-supervised work of Kingma et al; although this work has sometimes more than two latent nodes, it is not a complex extension). There is a fairly classical auxiliary variable trick used to make sure the inference network for y is trained over all data points (by supposing y is in fact is a latent variable with an observation 	ilde y; the observation is y if y is observed, or uninformative for unobserved y). Alternatively, one can separate the inference used to learn the generative model (which throws out inference over y if it is observed), from an inference used to *exercise* the model (approximate the complex p(y|x) in the model by a simpler q(y|x) - effectively inferring the target p(y|x) for the data where only x is collected). Results are strong, although on simple datasets. Overall this is a well written, interesting paper, but lacking in terms of methodological advances. Minor: - I feel the title is a bit too general for the content of the paper. I personally don*t agree with the strong contrast made between deep generative models and graphical models (deep generative models are graphical models, but they are more typically learned and un-interpretable than classical graphical models; and having multiple stochastic variables is not exclusive to graphical models, see DRAW, Deep Kalman Filter, Recurrent VAE, etc.). The word *structure* is a bit problematic; here, the paper seems more concerned with disentangling and semanticizing the latent representation of a generative model by supervision. It is debatable whether the models themselves have structure.","The reviewer acknowledges the paper is ""well-written, interesting"" and highlights the ""strong results"". However, they also point out a lack of methodological novelty, deeming it similar to existing work.

"This paper is a follow-up on the NIPS 2016 paper *Unsupervised learning of spoken language with visual context*, and does exactly what that paper proposes in its future work section: *to perform acoustic segmentation and clustering, effectively learning a lexicon of word-like units* using the embeddings that their system learns. The analysis is very interesting and I really like where the authors are going with this. My main concern is novelty. It feels like this work is a rather trivial follow-up on an existing model, which is fine, but then the analysis should be more satisfying: currently, it feels like the authors are just illustrating some of the things that the NIPS model (with some minor improvements) learns. For a more interesting analysis, I would have liked things like a comparison of different segmentation approaches (both in audio and in images), i.e., suppose we have access to the perfect segmentation in both modalities, what happens? It would also be interesting to look at what is learned with the grounded representation, and evaluate e.g. on multi-modal semantics tasks. Apart from that, the paper is well written and I really like this research direction. It is very important to analyze what models learn, and this is a good example of the types of questions one should ask. I am afraid, however, that the model is not novel enough, nor the questions deep enough, to make this paper better than borderline for ICLR.","The reviewer finds the research direction interesting and acknowledges the importance of the analysis.

"This paper takes a first step towards learning to statically analyze source code. It develops a simple toy programming language that includes loops and branching. The aim is to determine whether all variables in the program are defined before they are used. The paper tries a variety of off-the-shelf sequence classification models and develops a new model that makes use of a ``differentiable set** to keep track of which variables have been defined so far. Result show that an LSTM model can achieve 98% accuracy, and the differentiable set model can achieve 99.3% accuracy with sequence-level supervision and 99.7% accuracy with strong token-level supervision. An additional result is used whereby an LSTM language model is trained over correct code, and then low probability (where a threshold to determine low is tuned by hand) tokens are highlighted as sources of possible error. One further question is if the authors could clarify what reasoning patterns are needed to solve these problems. Does the model need to, e.g., statically determine whether an `if` condition can ever evaluate to true in order to solve these tasks? Or is it just as simple as checking whether a variable appears on a LHS before it appears on a RHS later in the textual representation of the program? Strengths: - Learning a static analyzer is an interesting concept, and I think there is good potential for this line of work - The ability to determine whether variables are defined before they are used is certainly a prerequisite for more complicated static analysis. - The experimental setup seems reasonable - The differentiable set seems like a useful (albeit simple) modelling tool Weaknesses: - The setup is very toy, and it*s not clear to me that this makes much progress towards the challenges that would arise if one were trying to learn a static analyzer - The models are mostly very simple. The one novelty on the modelling front (the differentiable set) provides a small win on this task, but it*s not clear if it is a useful general construct or not. Overall: I think it*s an interesting start, and I*m eager to see how this line of work progresses. In my opinion, it*s a bit too early to accept this work to ICLR, but I*d be excited about seeing what happens as the authors try to push the system to learn to analyze more properties of code, and as they push towards scenarios where the learned static analyzer would be useful, perhaps leveraging strengths of machine learning that are not available to standard programming languages analyses.","The reviewer finds the paper to be a good start with interesting ideas (positive), but ultimately too preliminary for acceptance (negative).

"The proposed approach consists in a greedy layer wise initialization strategy for a deep MLP model, which is followed by global gradient-descent with dropout for fine-tuning. The initialization strategy uses a first randomly initialized sigmoid layer for dimensionality expansion followed by 2 sigmoid layers whose weights are initialized by Marginal Fisher Analysis (MFA) which learns a linear dimensionality reduction based on a neighborhood graph constructed using class label information (i.e. supervised dimensionality reduction). Output layer is a standard softmax layer. The approach is thus to be added to a growing list of heuristic layer-wise initialization schemes. The particular choice of initialization strategy, while reasonable, is not sufficiently well motivated in the paper relative to alternatives, and thus feels rather arbitrary. The paper lacks clarity in the description of the approach: MFA is poorly explained with undefined notations (in Eq. 4, what is A? It has not been properly defined); the precise use of alluded denoising in the model is also unclear (is there really training of an additional denoting objective, or just input corruption?). The question of the (arguably mild) inconsistency of applying a linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, that is trained without any sigmoid, and then passing its learned representation through a sigmoid is not even raised. This, in addition to the fact that sigmoid hidden layers are no longer commonly used (why did you not also consider using RELUs?). More importantly I suspect methodological problems with the experimental comparisons: the paper mentions using *default* values for learning-rate and momentum, and having (arbitrarily?) fixed epoch to 400 (no early stopping?) and L2 regularization to 1e-4 for some models. *All* hyper parameters should always be properly hyper-optimized using a validation set (or cross-validation) including early-stopping, and this separately for each model under comparison (ideally also including layer sizes). This is all the more important since you are considering smallish datasets, so that the various initialization strategies act mainly as different indirect regularization schemes: they thus need to be carefully tuned. This casts serious doubts as to the amount of hyper-parameter tuning (close to none?) that went into training the alternative models used for comparison. The Marginal Fisher Analysis dimensionality reduction initialization strategy may well offer advantages, but as it currently stands this paper doesn’t yet make a sufficiently convincing case for it, nor provide useful insights into the nature of the expected advantages. I would also suggest, for image inputs such as CIFAR10, to use the qualitative tool of showing the filters (back projected to input space) learned by the different initialization schemes under consideration, as this could help visually gain insight as to what sets methods apart.","The review is highly critical of the paper's methodology and clarity.

"Because the authors did not respond to reviewer feedback, I am maintaining my original review score. ----- This paper proposes to model relational (i.e., correlated) time series using a deep learning-inspired latent variable approach: they design a flexible parametric (but not generative) model with Gaussian latent factors and fit it using a rich training objective including terms for reconstruction (of observed time series) error, smoothness in the latent state space (via a KL divergence term encouraging neighbor states to be similarly distributed), and a final regularizer that encourages related time series to have similar latent state trajectories. Relations between trajectories are hard coded based on pre-existing knowledge, i.e., latent state trajectories for neighboring (wind speed) base stations should be similar. The model appears to be fit using gradient simple descent. The authors propose several elaborations, including a nonlinear transition function (based on an MLP) and a reconstruction error term that takes variance into account. However, the model is restricted to using a linear decoder. Experimental results are positive but not convincing. Strengths: - The authors target a worthwhile and challenging problem: incorporating the modeling of uncertainty over hidden states with the power of flexible neural net-like models. - The idea of representing relationships between hidden states using KL divergence between their (distributions over) corresponding hidden states is clever. Combined with the Gaussian distribution over hidden states, the resulting regularization term is simple and differentiable. - This general approach -- focusing on writing down the problem as a neural network-like loss function -- seems robust and flexible and could be combined with other approaches, including variants of variational autoencoders. Weaknesses: - The presentation is a muddled, especially the model definition in Sec. 3.3. The authors introduce four variants of their model with different combinations of decoder (with and without variance term) and linear vs. MLP transition function. It appears that the 2,2 variant is generally better but not on all metrics and often by small margins. This makes drawing a solid conclusions difficult: what each component of the loss contributes, whether and how the nonlinear transition function helps and how much, how in practice the model should be applied, etc. I would suggest two improvements to the manuscript: (1) focus on the main 2,2 variant in Sec. 3.3 (with the hypothesis that it should perform best) and make the simpler variants additional *baselines* described in a paragraph in Sec. 4.1; (2) perform more thorough experiments with larger data sets to make a stronger case for the superiority of this approach. - The authors only allude to learning (with references to gradient descent and ADAM during model description) in this framework. Inference gets its one subsection but only one sentence that ends in an ellipsis (?). - It*s unclear what is the purpose of introducing the inequality in Eq. 9. - Experimental results are not convincing: given the size of the data, the differences vs. the RNN and KF baselines is probably not significant, and these aren*t particularly strong baselines (especially if it is in fact an RNN and not an LSTM or GRU). - The position of this paper is unclear with respect to variational autoencoders and related models. Recurrent variants of VAEs (e.g., Krishnan, et al., 2015) seem to achieve most of the same goals as far as uncertainty modeling is concerned. It seems like those could easily be extended to model relationships between time series using the simple regularization strategy used here. Same goes for Johnson, et al., 2016 (mentioned in separate question). This is a valuable research direction with some intriguing ideas and interesting preliminary results. I would suggest that the authors restructure this manuscript a bit, striving for clarity of model description similar to the papers cited above and providing greater detail about learning and inference. They also need to perform more thorough experiments and present results that tell a clear story about the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.","The review starts with a neutral statement about maintaining the original score due to lack of author response.

"The paper proposes a semantic embedding based approach to multilabel classification. Conversely to previous proposals, SEM considers the underlying parameters determining the observed labels are low-rank rather than that the observed label matrix is itself low-rank. However, It is not clear to what extent the difference between the two assumptions is significant SEM models the labels for an instance as draws from a multinomial distribution parametrized by nonlinear functions of the instance features. As such, it is a neural network. The proposed training algorithm is slightly more complicated than vanilla backprop. The significance of the results compared to NNML (in particular on large datasets Delicious and EUrlex) is not very clear. The paper is well written and the main idea is clearly presented.

"The paper presents a large-scale visual search system for finding product images given a fashion item. The exploration is interesting and the paper does a nice job of discussing the challenges of operating in this domain. The proposed approach addresses several of the challenges. However, there are several concerns. 1) The main concern is that there are no comparisons or even mentions of the work done by Tamara Berg’s group on fashion recognition and fashion attributes, e.g., - “Automatic Attribute Discovery and Characterization from Noisy Web Data” ECCV 2010 - “Where to Buy It: Matching Street Clothing Photos in Online Shops” ICCV 2015, - “Retrieving Similar Styles to Parse Clothing, TPAMI 2014, etc It is difficult to show the contribution and novelty of this work without discussing and comparing with this extensive prior art. 2) There are not enough details about the attribute dataset and the collection process. What is the source of the images? Are these clean product images or real-world images? How is the annotation done? What instructions are the annotators given? What annotations are being collected? I understand data statistics for example may be proprietary, but these kinds of qualitative details are important to understand the contributions of the paper. How can others compare to this work? 3) There are some missing baselines. How do the results in Table 2 compare to simpler methods, e.g., the BM or CM methods described in the text?

"The multiagent system is proposed as a generalization of neural network. The proposed system can be used with less restrictive network structures more efficiently by computing only those necessary computations in the graph. Unfortunately, I don*t find the proposed system different from the framework of artificial neural network. Although for today*s neural network structures are designed to have a lot of matrix-matrix multiplications, but it is not limited to have such architecture. In other words, the proposed multiagent system can be framed in the artificial neural network with more complicated layer/connectivity structures while considering each neuron as layer. The computation efficiency is argued among different sparsely connected denoising autoencoder in multiagent system framework only but the baseline comparison should be against the fully-connected neural network that employs matrix-matrix multiplication.","The reviewer finds the proposed system not significantly different from existing artificial neural networks, suggesting it's more of a reframing than a novel approach.

"This paper proposes to use a causality score to weight a sparsity regularizer. In that way, selected variables trade off between being causal and discriminative. The framework is primarily evaluated on a proprietary health dataset. While the dataset does give a good motivation to the problem setting, the paper falls a bit short for ICLR due to the lack of additional controlled experiments, relatively straightforward methodology (given the approach of Chalupka et al., arXiv Preprint, 2016, which is a more interesting paper from a technical perspective), and paucity of theoretical motivation. At the core of this paper, the approach is effectively to weight a sparsity regularizer so that *causal* variables (as determined by a separate objective) are more likely to be selected. This is generally a good idea, but we do not get a proper validation of this from the experiments as ground truth is absent. A theorem on identifiability of causal+discriminative variables from a data sample combined with adequate synthetic experiments would have probably been sufficient, for example, to push the paper towards accept from a technical perspective, but as it is, it is lacking in insight and reproducibility.","The review starts with a neutral statement, presenting the paper's proposal.

Neither do the authors ever motivate why do such a training as opposed to the standard back-prop. What are its advantages/dis-advantages? Furthermore the experimental section is equally unclear.

"This paper introduces a neural network architecture and training procedure for predicting the speed of a vehicle several seconds into the future based on video and vehicle state input. The architecture allows several RNNs to compete to make the best predictions, with only the best prediction receiving back propagation training at each time step. Preliminary experimental results show that this scheme can yield reduced prediction error. It is not clear how the best-performing RNN is chosen for each time point at test time. That is, how is the “integrated prediction” obtained in Fig. 7? Is the prediction the one with minimum error over all of the output layers? If so, this means the prediction cannot be made until you already know the value to be predicted. It seems possible that a larger generic RNN might be able to generate accurate predictions. If I understand correctly, the competitive architectures have many more parameters than the baseline. Is the improved performance here due to the competitive scheme, or just a larger model? A large amount of additional work is required to sustain the claim that this scheme is successfully extracting driver ‘intentions’. It would be interesting to see if the scheme, suitably extended, can automatically infer the intention to stop at a stop sign vs slowing but not stopping due to a car in front, say, or to pass a car vs simply changing lanes. Adding labels to the dataset may enable this comparison more clearly. More generally, the intention of the driver seems more related to the goals they are pursuing at the moment; there is a fair amount of work in inverse reinforcement learning that examines this problem (some of it in the context of driving style as well).","The review is cautiously positive. It acknowledges the potential of the proposed architecture and the promising preliminary results (""this scheme can yield reduced prediction error"").

"This paper investigates whether the variational inference interpretation of dropout, as introduced in [Gal & Ghahramani (2016), and Kingma et al (2015)], can lead to good estimates of mode uncertainty outside of the training distribution. This is an area of research that indeed warrants more experimental investigation. One very interesting finding is that MC integration leads to much calibration, thus probably much better out-of-sample prediction, than the more usual. Critique: - As explained in Kingma et al (2015), when using continuous posterior distributions over the weights, the dropout rate can be optimized, leading to better regularization. While the paper is cited in the introduction, this adaptive form of dropout is missing from experiments, without clarification. - Only the dropout rate p=0.5 was used across experiments, while the optimal rate is problem dependent, as found by earlier published work. - No new ideas are presented, and the analysis in the paper is quite limited. As it stands, this would be more appropriate for a workshop.","The review starts with a positive note, acknowledging the relevance of the research topic and highlighting an interesting finding (calibrated MC integration). However, it then presents three main critiques, suggesting the paper lacks novelty and depth ('No new ideas...', '...analysis in the paper is quite limited'), and points out methodological limitations.

"The paper proposes a modified DAE objective where it is the mapped representation of the corrupted input that is pushed closer to the representation of the uncorrupted input. This thus borrows from both denoising (DAE) for the stochasticity and from the contractive (CAE) auto-encoders objectives (which the paper doesn’t compare to) for the representational closeness, and as such appears rather incremental. In common with the CAE, a collapse of the representation can only be avoided by additional external constraints, such as tied weights, batch normalization or other normalization heuristics. While I appreciates that the authors added a paragraph discussing this point and the usual remediations after I had raised it in an earlier question, I think it would deserve a proper formal treatment. Note that such external constraints do not seem to arise from the information-theoretic formalism as articulated by the authors. This casts doubt regarding the validity or completeness of the proposed formal motivation as currently exposed. What the extra regularization does from an information-theoretic perspective remains unclearly articulated (e.g. interpretation of lambda strength?). On the experimental front, empirical support for the approach is very weak: few experiments on synthetic and small scale data. The modified DAE*s test errors on MNIST are larger than those of Original DAE all the time expect for one precise setting of lambda, and then the original DAE performance is still within the displayed error-bar of the modified DAE. So, it is unclear whether the improvement is actually statistically significant.","The review is critical of the paper's novelty, theoretical grounding, and experimental validation.

"My main objection with this work is that it operates under a hypothesis (that is becoming more and more popular in the literature) that all we need is to have gradients flow in order to solve long term dependency problems. The usual approach is then to enforce orthogonal matrices which (in absence of the nonlinearity) results in unitary jacobians, hence the gradients do not vanish and do not explode. However this hypothesis is taken for granted (and we don*t know it is true yet) and instead of synthetic data, we do not have any empirical evidence that is strong enough to convince us the hypothesis is true. My own issues with this way of thinking is: a) what about representational power; restricting to orthogonal matrices it means we can not represent the same family of functions as before (e.g. we can*t have complex attractors and so forth if we run the model forward without any inputs). You can only get those if you have eigenvalues larger than 1. It also becomes really hard to deal with noise (since you attempt to preserve every detail of the input, or rather every part of the input affects the output). Ideally you would want to preserve only what you need for the task given limited capacity. But you can*t learn to do that. My issue is that everyone is focused on solving this preserved issue without worrying of the side-effects. I would like one of these papers going for jacobians having eigenvalues of 1 show this helps in realistic scenarios, on complex datasets.","The reviewer expresses a strong negative sentiment by stating a fundamental disagreement with the core hypothesis of the paper and the popular approach in the field. They back their argument with several points and call for empirical evidence instead of just relying on theoretical assumptions.

"This paper aims to mine explicit rules from KB embedding space, and casts it into a sparse reconstruction problem. Experiments demonstrate its ability of extracting reasonable rules on a few link prediction datasets. The solution part sounds plausible. However, it confuses me that why we need to mine rules from learned KB embeddings. - It is still unclear what information these KB embeddings encode and it looks strange that we aim to learn rules including negation / disjunction from them. - If the goal is to extract useful rules (for other applications), it is necessary to compare it to “graph random walk” (http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/papers/lao-emnlp11.pdf) which could learn rules from KB graph directly. - As there is only one KNN baseline, the experimental results seem pretty weak. At the least, it is necessary to show the original precision / recall of RESCAL, together with the proposed rule mining approach (with different max length), so we know how much the current information the current rule miner could recover. In addition, the four datasets are all very small. Would it be able to scale it to WordNet or Freebase?

"The paper proposes a new criterion (sample importance) to study the impact of samples during the training of deep neural networks. This criterion is not clearly defined (the term phi^t_{i,j} is never defined, only phi^t_i is defined; Despite the unclear definition, it is understood that sample importance is the squared l2 norm of the gradient for a sample i and at time t strangely scaled by the squared learning rate (the learning rate should have nothing to do with the importance of a sample in this context). The paper presents experiments on the well known MNIST and CIFAR datasets with correspondingly appropriate network architectures and choice of hyper-parameters and initialisations. The size of the hidden layers is a bit small for Mnist and very small for CIFAR (this could explain the very poor performance in figure 6: 50% error on CIFAR) The study of the evolution of sample importance during training depending on layers seems to lead to trivial conclusions - “the overall sample importance is different under different epochs” => yes the norm of the gradient is expected to vary - “Output layer always has the largest average sample importance per parameter, and its contribution reaches the maximum in the early training stage and then drops” => 1. yes since the gradient flows backwards, the gradient is expected to be stronger for the output layer and it is expected to become more diffuse as it propagates to lower layers which are not stable. As learning progresses one would expect the output layer to have progressively smaller gradients. 2. the norm of the gradient depends on the scaling of the variables The question of Figure 4 is absurd “Is Sample Importance the same as Negative log-likelihood of a sample?”. Of course not. The results are very bad on CIFAR which discredits the applicability of those results. On Mnist performance is not readable (figure 7): Error rate should only be presented between 0 and 10 or 20% Despite these important issues (there are others), the paper manages to raises some interesting things: the so-called easy samples and hard samples do seem to correspond (although the study is very preliminary in this regard) to what would intuitively be considered easy (the most representative/canonical samples) and hard (edge cases) samples. Also the experiments are very well presented.","The reviewer raises several serious concerns about the paper, including unclear definitions, questionable methodology, and poor results on one of the datasets.

"I agree with the other two reviewers that it is an interesting topic to investigate the feature learned by DML. For classification task though, I feel intuitively softmax should have advantages over distance metric learning method because the loss function is designed to assign the correct class for the given image. All the experimental results show that the softmax features work better than Rippel et al DML method. However, does it support the claim that softmax-based features work much better than DML learned features? I have doubts on this claim. Also the experiments are a little bit misleading. What is vanilla googleNet softmax finetuned results? It seems it is not Rippel et al. (softmax prob) result. I am wondering whether the improvement comes from a) using retrieval (nearest neighbor) for classification or b) adding a new layer on top of pool5 or c) L2 normalization of the features. It is not clear to me at all. It appears to me the comparison is not apple vs apple between the proposed method and Rippel et al.

"The paper starts by pointing out the need for methods that perform both state and temporal representation learning for RL and which allow gaining insight into what is being learned (perhaps in order to allow a human operator to intervene if necessary). This is a very important goal from a practical point of view, and it is great to see research in this direction. For this reason, I would like to encourage the authors to pursue this further. However, I am not at all convinced that the current incarnation of this work is the right answer. Part of the issues are more related to presentation, part may require rethinking. In order to get the *interpretability*, the authors opt for some fairly specific ways of performing abstraction. For example, their skills always start In a single skill initiation state, and likewise end in one state. This seems unnecessarily restrictive, and it is not clear why this restriction is needed (other than convenience). Similarly, clustering is the basis for forming the higher level states, and there is a specific kind of clustering used here. Again, it is not clear why this has to be done via clustering as opposed to other methods. Ensuring temporal coherence in the particular form employed also seems restrictive. There is a reference to supplementary material where some of these choices are explained, but I could not find this in the posted version of the paper. The authors should either explain clearly why these specific choices are necessary, or (even better) try to think if they can be relaxed while still keeping interpretability. From a presentation point of view, the paper would benefit from formal definitions of AMDP and SAMDP, as well as from formal descriptions of the algorithms employed in constructing these representations (eg Bellman equations for the models, and update rules for the algorithms learning them). While intuitions are given, the math is not precisely stated. The overhead of constructing an SAMDP (computation time and space) should be clarified as well. The experiments are well carried out and it is nice to have both gridworld experiments, where visualization are easy to perform and understand, as well as Atari games (gridworld still have their place despite what other reviewers might say). The results are positive, but because the proposed approach has many moving parts which rely on specific choices, significance and general ease of use are unclear at this point.

"The paper discusses sub modular sum-product networks as a tractable extension for classical sum-product networks. The proposed approach is evaluated on semantic segmentation tasks and some early promising results are provided. Summary: ——— I think the paper presents a compelling technique for hierarchical reasoning in MRFs but the experimental results are not yet convincing. Moreover the writing is confusing at times. See below for details. Quality: I think some of the techniques could be described more carefully to better convey the intuition. Clarity: Some of the derivations and intuitions could be explained in more detail. Originality: The suggested idea is great. Significance: Since the experimental setup is somewhat limited according to my opinion, significance is hard to judge at this point in time. Detailed comments: ——— 1. I think the clarity of the paper would benefit significantly from fixes to inaccuracies. E.g., alpha-expansion and belief propagation are not `scene-understanding algorithms’ but rather approaches for optimizing energy functions. Computing the MAP state of an SSPN in time sub-linear in the network size seems counterintuitive because it means we are not allowed to visit all the nodes in the network. The term `deep probabilistic model’ should probably be defined. The paper states that InferSSPN computes `the approximate MAP state of the SSPN (equivalently, the optimal parse of the image)’ and I’m wondering how the `approximate MAP state* can be optimal. Etc. 2. Albeit being formulated for scene understanding tasks, no experiments demonstrate the obtained results of the proposed technique. To assess the applicability of the proposed approach a more detailed analysis is required. More specifically, the technique is evaluated on a subset of images which makes comparison to any other approach impossible. According to my opinion, either a conclusive experimental evaluation using, e.g., IoU metric should be given in the paper, or a comparison to publicly available results is possible. 3.

"Summary: In this paper, the authors explore the advantages/disadvantages of using a sin activation function. They first demonstrate that even with simple tasks, using sin activations can result in complex to optimize loss functions. They then compare networks trained with different activations on the MNIST dataset, and discover that the periodicity of the sin activation is not necessary for learning the task well. They then try different algorithmic tasks, where the periodicity of the functions is helpful. Pros: The closed form derivations of the loss surface were interesting to see, and the clarity of tone on the advantages *and* disadvantages was educational. Cons: Seems like more of a preliminary investigation of the potential benefits of sin, and more evidence (to support or in contrary) is needed to conclude anything significant -- the results on MNIST seem to indicate truncated sin is just as good, and while it is interesting that tanh maybe uses more of the saturated part, the two seem relatively interchangeable.

"The authors present a method for training probabilistic models by maximizing a stochastic variational-lower-bound-type objective. Training involves sampling and then learning a transition-based inference to *walk back* samples to the data. Because of its focus on transitions, it can be used to learn a raw transition operator rather than purely learning an energy-based model. The objective is intuitively appealing because of its similarity to previous successful but less principled training methods for MRFs like Contrastive Divergence. The idea for the algorithm is appealing, and it looks like it could find a nice place in the literature. However, the submission in its current form is not yet ready for publication. Experiments are qualitative and the generated samples are not obviously indicative of a high model quality. As pointed out elsewhere, the mathematical analysis does not currently demonstrate tightness of the variational bound in the case of a learned transition operator. More evaluation using e.g. annealed importance sampling to estimate held-out likelihoods is necessary. Assuming that the analysis can be repaired, the ability to directly parametrize a transition operator, an interesting strength of this method, should be explored in further experiments and contrasted with the more standard energy-based modeling. This looks like a promising idea, and other reviews and questions have already raised some important technical points which should help strengthen this paper for future submission.","The review starts with positive remarks, highlighting the appeal and potential of the method. However, it then lists several significant weaknesses, including the lack of quantitative results and concerns about the theoretical analysis.

The findings of applying sparsity in the backward gradients for training LSTMs is interesting. But the paper seems incomplete without the proper experimental justification. Only the validation loss is reported which is definitely insufficient. Proper testing results and commonly reported evaluation criterion needs to be included to support the claim of no degradation when applying the proposed sparsity technique. Also actual justification of the gains in terms of speed and efficiency would make the paper much stronger.,"The review starts with recognizing the value of the research (""interesting findings""), suggesting a somewhat positive sentiment.

"Updated review: the authors did an admirable job of responding to and incorporating reviewer feedback. In particular, they put a lot of effort into additional experiments, even incorporating a new and much stronger baseline (the ConvNet -> LSTM baseline requested by multiple reviewers). I still have two lingering concerns previously stated -- that each model*s architecture (# hidden units, etc.) should be tuned independently and that a pure time series forecasting baselines (without the trend preprocessing) should be tried. I*m going to bump up my score from a clear rejection to a borderline. ----- This paper is concerned with time series prediction problems for which the prediction targets include the slope and duration of upcoming local trends. This setting is of great interest in several real world problem settings (e.g., financial markets) where decisions (e.g., buy or sell) are often driven by local changes and trends. The primary challenge in these problems is distinguishing true changes and trends (i.e., a downturn in share price) from noise. The authors tackle this with an interesting hybrid architecture (TreNet) with four parts: (1) preprocessing to extract trends, (2) an LSTM that accepts those trends as inputs to ostensibly capture long term dependencies, (3) a ConvNet that accepts a local window of raw data as its input at each time step, and (4) a higher *feature fusion* (i.e., dense) layer to combine the LSTM*s and ConvNet*s outputs. On three univariate time series data sets, the TreNet outperforms the competing baselines including those based on its constituent parts (LSTM + trend inputs, CNN). Strengths: - A very interesting problem setting that can plausibly be argued to differ from other sequential modeling problems in deep learning (e.g., video classification). This is a nice example of fairly thoughtful task-driven machine learning. - Accepting the author*s assumptions as true for the moment, the proposed architecture seems intuitive and well-designed. Weaknesses: - Although this is an interesting problem setting (decisions driven by trends and changes), the authors did not make a strong argument for why they formulated the machine learning task as they did. Trend targets are not provided from *on high* (by data oracle) but extracted from raw data using a deterministic algorithm. Thus, one could just easily formulate this as plain time series forecasting problem in which we forecast the next 100 steps and then apply the trend extractor to convert those predictions into a trend. If the forecasts are accurate, so will be the extracted trends. - The proposed architecture, while interesting, is not justified, in particular the choice to feed the extracted trends and raw data into separate LSTM and ConvNet layers that are only combined at the end by a shallow MLP. An equally straightforward but more intuitive choice would have been to feed the output of the ConvNet into the LSTM, perhaps augmented by the trend input. Without a solid rationale, this unconventional choice comes across as arbitrary. - Following up on that point, the raw->ConvNet->LSTM and {raw->ConvNet,trends}->LSTM architectures are natural baselines for experiments. - The paper presupposes, rather than argues, the value of the extracted trends and durations as inputs. It is not unreasonable to think that, with enough training data, a sufficiently powerful ConvNet->LSTM architecture should be able to learn to detect these trends in raw data, if they are predictive. - Following up on that point, two other obvious baselines that were omitted: raw->LSTM and {raw->ConvNet,trends}->MLP. Basically, the authors propose a complex architecture without demonstrating the value of each part (trend extraction, LSTM, ConvNet, MLP). The baselines are unnecessarily weak. One thing I am uncertain about in general: the validity of the practice of using the same LSTM and ConvNet architectures in both the baselines and the TreNet. This *sounds* like an apples-to-apples comparison, but in the world of hyperparameter tuning, it could in fact disadvantage either. It seems like a more thorough approach would be to optimize each architecture independently. Regarding related work and baselines: I think it is fair to limit the scope of in-depth analysis and experiments to a set of reasonable, representative baselines, at least in a conference paper submitted to a deep learning conference. That said, the authors ignored a large body of work on financial time series modeling using probabilistic models and related techniques. This is another way to frame the above *separate trends from noise* problem: treat the observations as noisy. One semi-recent example: J. Hernandez-Lobato, J. Lloyds, and D. Hernandez-Lobato. Gaussian process conditional copulas with applications to financial time series. NIPS 2013. I appreciate this research direction in general, but at the moment, I believe that the work described in this manuscript is not suitable for inclusion at ICLR. My policy for interactive review is to keep an open mind and willingness to change my score, but a large revision is unlikely. I would encourage the authors to instead use their time and energy -- and reviewer feedback -- in order to prepare for a future conference deadline (e.g., ICML).","The review starts with a positive note, acknowledging the authors' efforts in addressing previous feedback and even upgrading the score to borderline.

"The paper proposes two methods for what is called wild variational inference. The goal is to obtain samples from the variational approximate distribution q without requiring to evaluate the density q(z) by which it becomes possible to consider more flexible family of distributions. The authors apply the proposed method to the problem of optimizing the hyperparamter of the SGLD sampler. The experiments are performed on a 1-d mixture of gaussian distribution and Bayesian logistic regression tasks. The key contribution seems to connect the previous findings in SVGD and KSD to the concept of inference networks, and to use them for hyperparameter optimization of SGLD. This can not only be considered as a rather simple connection/extension, but also the toyish experiments are not enough to convince readers on the significance of the proposed model. Particularly, I*m wondering how the particle based methods can deal with the multimodality (not the simple 1d gaussian mixture case) in general. Also, the method seems still to require to evaluate the true gradient of the target distribution (e.g., the posterior distribution) for each z ~ q. This seems to be a computational problem for large dataset settings. In the experiments, the authors compare the methods for the same number of update steps. But, considering the light computation of SGLD per update, I think SGLD can make much more updates per unit time than the proposed methods, particularly for large datasets. The Bayesian logistic regression on 54 dimensions seems also a quite simple experiment, considering that its posterior is close to a Gaussian distribution. Also, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with automatic hyperparameter tuning mechanism (like, no u-turn sampler) would be interesting. The paper is written very unclearly. Especially, it is not clear what is the exact contributions of the paper compared to the other previous works including the authors* works. The main message is quite simple but most of the pages are spent to explain previous works. Overall, I*d like to suggest to have more significant high-dimension, large scale experiments, and to improve the writing.","The reviewer raises several significant concerns about the paper, questioning the novelty and significance of the contribution.

"The papers investigates the task of unsupervised learning with deep features via k-means clustering. The entire pipeline can be decomposed into two steps: (1) unsupervised feature learning based on GAN framework and (2) k-means clustering using learned deep network features. Following the GAN framework and its extension InfoGAN, the first step is to train a pair of discriminator network and generator network from scratch using min-max objective. Then, it applies k-means clustering on the top layer features from discriminator network. For evaluation, the proposed unsupervised feature learning approach is compared against traditional hand-crafted features such as HOG and supervised method on three benchmark datasets. Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Adjusted RAND Index (ARI) have been used as the evaluation metrics for experimental comparison. Although the proposed method may be potentially useful in practice (if refined further), I find the method lacks novelty, and the experimental results are not significant enough.","The review starts with a neutral, factual tone, explaining the paper's topic and approach.

"In this paper, the authors extend the f-GAN by using Bregman divergences for density ratio matching. The argument against f-GAN (which is a generalization of the regular GAN) is that the actual objective optimized by the generator during training is different from the theoretically motivated objective due to gradient issues with the theoretically motivated objective. In b-GANS, the discriminator is a density ratio estimator (r(x) = p(x) / q(x)), and the generator tries to minimize the f-divergence between p and q by writing p(x) = r(x)q(x). My main problem with this paper is that it is unclear why any of this is useful. The connection to density estimation is interesting, but any derived conclusions between the two seem questionable. For example, in previous density estimation literature, the Pearson divergence is more stable. The authors claim that the same holds for GANS and try to show this in their experiments. Unfortunately, the experiments section is very confusing with unilluminating figures. Looking at the graph of density ratios is not particularly illuminating. They claim that for the Pearson divergence and modified KL-divergence, *the learning did not stop* by looking at the graph of density ratios. This is completely hand-wavey and no further evidence is given to back this claim. Also, why was the normal GAN objective not tried in light of this analysis? Furthermore, it seems that despite criticizing normal GANs for using a heuristic objective for the generator, multiple heuristics objectives and tricks are used to make b-GAN work. I think this paper would be much improved if it was rewritten in a clear fashion. As it stands, it is difficult to understand the motivation or intuition behind this work.","The review starts with a neutral tone, explaining the paper's topic. However, it quickly turns critical, using phrases like ""My main problem with this paper is..."" and questioning the usefulness of the research.

"This paper argues that being able to handle recursion is very important for neural programming architectures — that handling recursion allows for strong generalization to out of domain test cases and learning from smaller amounts of training data. Most of the paper is a riff on the Reed & de Freitas paper on Neural Programmer Interpreters from ICLR 2016 which learns from program traces — this paper trains NPI models on traces that have recursive calls. The authors show how to verify correctness by evaluating the learned program on only a small set of base cases and reduction rules and impressively, show that the NPI architecture is able to perfectly infer Bubblesort and the Tower of Hanoi problems. What I like is that the idea is super simple and as the authors even mention, the only change is to the execution traces that the training pipeline gets to see. I’m actually not sure what the right take-away is — does this mean that we have effectively solved the neural programming problem when the execution traces are available? (and was the problem too easy to begin with?). For example, a larger input domain (as one of the reviewers also mentions) is MNIST digits and we can imagine a problem where the NPI must infer how to sort MNIST digits from highest to lowest. In this setting, having execution traces would effectively decouple the problem of recognizing the digits from that of inferring the program logic — and so the problem would be no harder than learning to recognize MNIST digits and learning to bubble sort from symbols. What is a problem where we have access to execution traces but cannot infer it using the proposed method?","The review is positive in its overall assessment, praising the simplicity and effectiveness of the approach, particularly highlighting the impressive results with Bubblesort and Tower of Hanoi.

"This work presents an LSTM based meta-learning framework to learn the optimization algorithm of a another learning algorithm (here a NN). The paper is globally well written and the presentation of the main material is clear. The crux of the paper: drawing the parallel between Robbins Monroe update rule and the LSTM update rule and exploit it to satisfy the two main desiderata of few shot learning (1- quick acquisition of new knowledge, 2- slower extraction of general transferable knowledge) is intriguing. Several tricks re-used from (Andrychowicz et al. 2016) such as parameter sharing and normalization, and novel design choices (specific implementation of batch normalization) are well motivated. The experiments are convincing. This is a strong paper. My only concerns/questions are the following: 1. Can it be redundant to use the loss, gradient and parameters as input to the meta-learner? Did you do ablative studies to make sure simpler combinations are not enough. 2. It would be great if other architectural components of the network can be learned in a similar fashion (number of neurons, type of units, etc.). Do you have an opinion about this? 3.

Bengio, Y. Bengio, and J. Cloutier. 1994) - I am convince Schmidhuber has done something, make sure you find it and update related work section. Overall, I like the paper.

"Attempts to use chatbots for every form of human-computer interaction has been a major trend in 2016, with claims that they could solve many forms of dialogs beyond simple chit-chat. This paper represents a serious reality check. While it is mostly relevant for Dialog/Natural Language venues (to educate software engineer about the limitations of current chatbots), it can also be published at Machine Learning venues (to educate researchers about the need for more realistic validation of ML applied to dialogs), so I would consider this work of high significance. Two important conjectures are underlying this paper and likely to open to more research. While they are not in writing, Antoine Bordes clearly stated them during a NIPS workshop presentation that covered this work. Considering the metrics chosen in this paper: 1) The performance of end2end ML approaches is still insufficient for goal oriented dialogs. 2) When comparing algorithms, relative performance on synthetic data is a good predictor of performance on natural data. This would be quite a departure from previous observations, but the authors made a strong effort to match the synthetic and natural conditions. While its original algorithmic contribution consists in one rather simple addition to memory networks (match type), it is the first time these are deployed and tested on a goal-oriented dialog, and the experimental protocol is excellent. The overall paper clarity is excellent and accessible to a readership beyond ML and dialog researchers. I was in particular impressed by how the short appendix on memory networks summarized them so well, followed by the tables that explained the influence of the number of hops. While this paper represents the state-of-the-art in the exploration of more rigorous metrics for dialog modeling, it also reminds us how brittle and somewhat arbitrary these remain. Note this is more a recommendation for future research than for revision. First they use the per-response accuracy (basically the next utterance classification among a fixed list of responses). Looking at table 3 clearly shows how absurd this can be in practice: all that matters is a correct API call and a reasonably short dialog, though this would only give us a 1/7 accuracy, as the 6 bot responses needed to reach the API call also have to be exact. Would the per-dialog accuracy, where all responses must be correct, be better? Table 2 shows how sensitive it is to the experimental protocol. I was initially puzzled that the accuracy for subtask T3 (0.0) was much lower that the accuracy for the full dialog T5 (19.7), until the authors pointed me to the tasks definitions (3.1.1) where T3 requires displaying 3 options while T5 only requires displaying one. For the concierge data, what would happen if ‘correct’ meant being the best, not among the 5-best? While I cannot fault the authors for using standard dialog metrics, and coming up with new ones that are actually too pessimistic, I can think of one way to represent dialogs that could result in more meaningful metrics in goal oriented dialogs. Suppose I sell Virtual Assistants as a service, being paid upon successful completion of a dialog. What is the metric that would maximize my revenue? In this restaurant problem, the loss would probably be some weighted sum of the number of errors in the API call, the number of turns to reach that API call and the number of rejected options by the user. However, such as loss cannot be measured on canned dialogs and would either require a real human user or an realistic simulator Another issue closely related to representation learning that this paper fails to address or explain properly is what happens if the vocabulary used by the user does not match exactly the vocabulary in the knowledge base. In particular, for the match type algorithm to code ‘Indian’ as ‘type of cuisine’, this word would have to occur exactly in the KB. I can imagine situations where the KB uses some obfuscated terminology, and we would like ML to learn the associations rather than humans to hand-describe them.","The review starts with positive statements, highlighting the significance of the work and praising the experimental protocol and clarity.

"This paper makes a valuable contribution to provide a more clear understanding of generative adversarial network (GAN) training procedure. With the new insight of the training dynamics of GAN, as well as its variant, the authors reveal the reason that why the gradient is either vanishing in original GAN or unstable in its variant. More importantly, they also provide a way to avoid such difficulties by introducing perturbation. I believe this paper will inspire more principled research in this direction. I am very interested in the perturbation trick to avoid the gradient instability and vanishment. In fact, this is quite related to dropout trick in where the perturbation can be viewed as Bernoulli distribution. It will be great if the connection can be discussed.

"Thank you for an interesting read. Pros - This paper tackles a very crucial problem of understanding communications between 2 agents. As more and more applications of reinforcement learning are being explored, this approach brings us back to a basic question. Is the problem solving approach of machines similar to that of humans. - The task is simple enough to make the post learning analysis intuitive. - It was interesting to see how informed agents made use of multiple symbols to transmit the message, where as agnostic agents relied only on 2 symbols. Cons - The task effectively boils down to image classification, if the 2 images sent are from different categories. The symbols used are effectively the image class which the second agent learns to assign to either of the images. By all means, this approach boils down to a transfer learning problem which could probably be trained much faster than a reinforcement learning algorithm.","The review starts with a positive note, appreciating the interesting read and listing out three clear pros of the paper.

"This paper offers a very interesting empirical observation regarding the memorization capacity of current large deep convolutional networks. It shows they are able to perfectly memorize full training-set input-to-label mapping, even with random labels (i.e. when label has been rendered independent of input), using the same architecture and hyper-parameters as used for training with correct labels, except for a longer time to convergence. Extensive experiments support the main argument of the paper. Reflexions and observations about finite-sample expressivity and implicit regularization with linear models fit logically within the main theme and are equally thought-provoking. While this work doesn’t propose much explanations for the good generalization abilities of what it clearly established as overparameterized models, it does compel the reader to think about the generalization problem from a different angle than how it is traditionally understood. In my view, raising good questions and pointing to apparent paradox is the initial spark that can lead to fundamental progress in understanding. So even without providing any clear answers, I think this work is a very valuable contribution to research in the field.

"This paper explores an important part of our field, that of automating architecture search.

"**Edit: Based on the discussion below, my main problem (#2) was not correct. I have changed my overall rating from a 3 to a 7** This paper makes a fascinating observation: one can introduce an action-dependent baseline (control variate) into REINFORCE, which introduces bias, and then include a correction term to remove the bias. The variance of the correction term is low relative to the REINFORCE update and the action-dependent baseline, and so this results in benefits. However, the paper is poorly executed. Below I list my concerns. 1. The paper tries to distinguish between *policy gradient* methods and *actor critic* methods by defining them in a non-standard way. Specifically, when this paper says *policy gradient* it means REINFORCE. Historically, the two have meant different things: some policy gradient algorithms are actor-critics (e.g., Degris et al*s INAC algorithm) while others are not (e.g. REINFORCE). 2. The proposed Q-Prop algorithm includes many interesting design choices that make in unclear what the real source of improved performance is. Is the improved performance due to the use of the action-dependent control variate? Would the same setup but using a state-value baseline still perform just as well? Are the performance benefits due to the use of an off-policy advantage estimation algorithm, GAE(lambda)? Or, would performance have been similar with an on-policy advantage estimation algorithm? What about if a different off-policy advantage estimation algorithm was used, like Retrace(lambda), GTD2, ETD, or WIS-LSTD? Or, is the improved performance due to the use of a replay buffer? Comparisons are not performed between variants of Q-Prop that show the importances of these different components. Rather the authors opt to show better performance on a benchmark task. I find this to be non-scientific, and more of a paper showing a feat of engineering (by combining many different ideas) than it is a research paper that studies the details of which parts of Q-Prop make it work well. For example, after reading this paper, it is not clear whether having the action-dependent baseline (or using the first order Taylor approximation for the baseline) is beneficial or not - it could be that the strong performance comes from GAE(lambda) or the use of a replay buffer. At the very least I would have expected comparisons to Q-Prop using a state-value baseline (which would then be a variant of REINFORCE using off-policy data and a replay buffer, and which would show whether the action-dependent baseline is important). 3. There is a fair amount of discussion about unbiased policy gradient algorithms, which is not accurate. Most policy gradient algorithms are biased, and making them unbiased tends to hurt performance. This is discussed in the paper *Bias in Natural Actor-Critic Algorithms*, which applies to non-natural algorithms as well. Also, I suspect that the use of GAE(lambda) results in the exact sort of bias discussed in that paper, even when lambda=1. As a result, Q-Prop may act more like an average reward method than expected. This should be discussed. 4. The proposed algorithm can be applied to deep architectures, just as most linear-time policy gradient algorithms can. However, it does not have to be applied to deep architectures. The emphasis on *deep* therefore seems to detract from the core ideas of the paper. 5. The paper repeatedly says that importance sampling based methods result in high variance. This ignores weighted importance sampling methods that have very low variance. A good example of this is Mahmood et al*s WIS-LSTD algorithm. WIS-LSTD has high computational complexity, so it would only be compared to on non-deep RL problems, of which there are plenty. Alternatively, algorithms like Retrace(lambda) have quite low variance since the likelihood ratios are never bigger than one. Others might argue that ETD algorithms are currently the most effective. The simple dismissal of these algorithms because the original importance sampling estimator proposed in 2000 has high variance is not sufficient. 6. The paper does not compare to natural actor-critic algorithms. Once the weights, w, have been computed, REINFORCE uses samples of states from the normalized discounted state distribution and samples of the corresponding returns to estimate the policy gradient. One of the main reasons Q-Prop should work better than REINFORCE is that it includes a control variate that reduces the variance of the policy gradient update after w has been computed. Now, compare this to natural policy gradient algorithms. Once the weights, w, have been computed (admittedly, using compatible features for the advantage estimation but any features for the state-value estimation) the resulting update is = w. That is, is has zero variance and does not require additional sampling. It is as though a perfect control variate was used. Furthermore, natural gradient algorithms can be applied to deep architectures. Degris et al*s INAC algorithm is linear time. Desjardin et al*s *natural neural networks* paper also discusses efficient implementations of natural gradients for neural networks. Dabney*s Natural Temporal Difference algorithms have linear time variants that fit this paper*s description of actor-critic algorithms. To summarize, given the weights w, REINFORCE has high variance, and Q-Prop claims to reduce the variance of REINFORCE. However, natural policy gradient methods have zero variance given the weights w. So, what is the benefit of Q-Prop over natural gradient algorithms using off-policy value function estimation methods to estimate Q (or A)? That is, why should we expect Q-Prop to perform better than NAC-LSTD using GAE(lambda) with experience replay in place of LSTD? 7. Equation (2) is false. The right side is proportional to the left side, not equal to it. There is a (1-gamma) term missing. There are also other typos throughout (e.g., Q and A sometimes are missing their action arguments). Although I have listed my concerns, I would like to re-iterate that I do find the idea of an action-dependent baseline fascinating. My problem with this paper is with its execution, not with the novelty, impact, or quality of the core idea.","The review is quite critical of the paper's execution and compares it to many other algorithms. However, the reviewer acknowledges the core idea as fascinating and impactful. The language, while direct, is professional and typical of academic peer reviews. Therefore, the sentiment is rather negative due to the execution issues, but not overly so because the core idea is appreciated.",-30,50
"Deep RL (using deep neural networks for function approximators in RL algorithms) have had a number of successes solving RL in large state spaces. This empirically driven work builds on these approaches. It introduces a new algorithm which performs better in novel 3D environments from raw sensory data and allows better generalization across goals and environments. Notably, this algorithm was the winner of the Visual Doom AI competition. The key idea of their algorithm is to use additional low-dimensional observations (such as ammo or health which is provided by the game engine) as a supervised target for prediction. Importantly, this prediction is conditioned on a goal vector (which is given, not learned) and the current action. Once trained the optimal action for the current state can be chosen as the action that maximises the predicted outcome according the goal. Unlike in successor feature representations, learning is supervised and there is no TD relationship between the predictions of the current state and the next state. There have been a number of prior works both in predicting future states as part of RL and goal driven function approximators which the authors review in section 2. The key contributions of this work are the focus on Monte Carlo estimation (rather than TD), the use of low-dimensional ‘measurements’ for prediction, the parametrized goals and, perhaps most importantly, the empirical comparison to relevant prior work. In addition to the comparison with Visual Doom AI, the authors show that their algorithm is able to learn generalizable policies which can respond, without further training, to limited changes in the goal. The paper is well-communicated and the empirical results compelling and will be of significant interest. Some minor potential improvements: There is an approximation in the supervised training as it is making an on-policy assumption but it learns from a replay buffer (with the Monte Carlo regression the expectation of the remainder of the trajectory is assumed to follow the current policy, but is being sampled from episodes generated by prior versions of the policy). This should be discussed. The algorithm uses additional metadata (the information about which parts of the sensory input are worth predicting) that the compared algorithms do not. I think this, and the limitations of this approach (e.g. it may not work well in a sensory environment if such measurements are not provided) should be mentioned more clearly.","The review is positive overall. The reviewer highlights the significance of the work, its empirical success, and its clear communication. While the reviewer points out areas for improvement, these are presented constructively and do not detract from the overall positive sentiment. The language used is polite and professional throughout.",75,80
"Interesting paper, definitely provides value to the community by discussing why large batch gradient descent does not work too well","The reviewer states that the paper is ""interesting"" and that it ""definitely provides value to the community"", which points to a positive sentiment.

"This paper addresses the problem of achieving differential privacy in a very general scenario where a set of teachers is trained on disjoint subsets of sensitive data and the student performs prediction based on public data labeled by teachers through noisy voting. I found the approach altogether plausible and very clearly explained by the authors. Adding more discussion of the bound (and its tightness) from Theorem 1 itself would be appreciated. A simple idea of adding perturbation error to the counts, known from differentially-private literature, is nicely re-used by the authors and elegantly applied in a much broader (non-convex setting) and practical context than in a number of differentially-private and other related papers. The generality of the approach, clear improvement over predecessors, and clarity of the writing makes the method worth publishing.","The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer finds the approach ""plausible and very clearly explained"", the idea ""nicely re-used"", ""elegantly applied"", and the method overall ""worth publishing"".  The single suggestion for improvement is minor. The language used is formal and respectful.",90,100
"The paper presents a new framework to solve the SR problem - amortized MAP inference and adopts a pre-learned affine projection layer to ensure the output is consistent with LR. Also, it proposes three different methods to solve the problem of minimizing cross-entropy. Generally, it is a great paper. However, I still have several comments: 1) The proposed amortized MAP inference is novel and different from the previous SR methods. Combined with GAN, this framework can obtain plausible and good results. Compared with another GAN-based SR methods - Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network, question may arise as to what this new formulation adds to the latest state-of-the-art. 2) Using an affine projection architecture as a constraint, the model do not need any corresponding {HR, LR} image pairs for training. However, when training the affine projection layer, we still need the {HR, LR} image pairs. Does it mean that we merely transfer this training procedure to the training of affine projection? 3) The paper presents many results of the framework, including the results of natural images from ImageNet. Can the author also provide the results of Set5, Set14 or BSD100, which are conventional test dataset for SR, so that we can perform a fair comparison with previous work. 4) I see that the size of the results of nature images presented in this paper are limited to 128*128. Can this framework perform well on images with larger size? Because SR will encounter input with arbitrary size. 5) A normal GAN will have a noise term as a latent space, so that it can be better illustrated as learning a distribution. Do the author try the noise vector? Overall, this paper provides a new framework for SR with solid theoretical analysis. The idea is novel and the author explore many methods. Though there still exist questions like the necessity and more experiments are needed. I think this work will will provide good inspiration to the community.","The reviewer starts with positive words like ""great paper"" and ""novel"", indicating a positive sentiment. However, they also raise several questions and call for more experiments, suggesting areas for improvement. Therefore, the sentiment is positive but not overwhelmingly so. The language used is polite and professional throughout, with constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.",60,80
"This paper proposes learning on the fly to represent a dialog as a graph (which acts as the memory), and is first demonstrated on the bAbI tasks. Graph learning is part of the inference process, though there is long term representation learning to learn graph transformation parameters and the encoding of sentences as input to the graph. This seems to be the first implementation of a differentiable memory as graph: it is much more complex than previous approaches like memory networks without significant gain in performance in bAbI tasks, but it is still very preliminary work, and the representation of memory as a graph seems much more powerful than a stack. Clarity is a major issue, but from an initial version that was constructive and better read by a computer than a human, the author proposed a hugely improved later version. This original, technically accurate (within what I understood) and thought provoking paper is worth publishing. The preliminary results do not tell us yet if the highly complex graph-based differentiable memory has more learning or generalization capacity than other approaches. The performance on the bAbI task is comparable to the best memory networks, but still worse than more traditional rule induction (see http://www.public.asu.edu/~cbaral/papers/aaai2016-sub.pdf). This is still clearly promising. The sequence of transformation in algorithm 1 looks sensible, though the authors do not discuss any other operation ordering. In particular, it is not clear to me that you need the node state update step T_h if you have the direct reference update step T_h,direct. It is striking that the only trick that is essential for proper performance is the ‘direct reference’ , which actually has nothing to do with the graph building process, but is rather an attention mechanism for the graph input: attention is focused on words that are relevant to the node type rather than the whole sentence. So the question “how useful are all these graph operations” remain. A much simpler version of a similar trick may have been proposed in the context of memory networks, also for ICLR*17 (see match type in *LEARNING END-TO-END GOAL-ORIENTED DIALOG* by Bordes et al) The authors also mention the time and size needed to train the model: is the issue arising for learning, inference or both? A description of the actual implementation would help (no pointer to open source code is provide). The author mentions Theano in one of my questions: how are the transformations compiled in advance as units? How is the gradient back-propagated through the graph is this one is only described at runtime? Typo: in the appendices B.2 and B.2.1, the right side of the equation that applies the update gate has h’_nu while it should be h_nu. In the references, the author could mention the pioneering work of Lee Giles on representing graphs with RNNs. Revision: I have improved my rating for the following reasons: - Pointers to an highly readable and well structured Theano source is provided. - The delta improvement of the paper has been impressive over the review process, and I am confident this will be an impactful paper. - Much simpler alternatives approaches such as Memory Networks seem to be plateauing for problems such as dialog modeling, we need alternatives. - The architecture is this work is still too complex, but this is often as we start with DNNs, and then find simplifications that actually improve performance","The reviewer finds the paper original, technically sound, and promising, warranting publication. They acknowledge significant improvements from the initial version. While the reviewer notes the complexity of the approach and lack of significant performance gains compared to simpler methods, they recognize its potential and the need for alternatives in the field. The reviewer's tone is constructive and professional throughout.",60,80

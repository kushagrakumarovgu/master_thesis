"The paper address the problem of detecting if an example is misclassified or out-of-distribution. This is an very important topic and the study provides a good baseline. Although it misses strong novel methods for the task, the study contributes to the community.","The sentiment in the review is mildly positive as the reviewer acknowledges the importance of the topic and the contribution of the study to the community, despite noting the lack of strong novel methods. The language used is polite and constructive, with no negative or harsh wording.",50,80
"This paper proposed a compare-aggregate model for the NLP tasks that require semantically comparing the text sequences, such as question answering and textual entailment. The basic framework of this model is to apply a convolutional neural network (aggregation) after a element-wise operation (comparison) over the attentive outputs of the LSTMs. The highlighted part is the comparison, where this paper compares several different methods for matching text sequences, and the element-wise subtraction/multiplication operations are demonstrated to achieve generally better performance on four different datasets. While the weak point is that this is an incremental work and a bit lack of innovation. A qualitative evaluation about how subtraction, multiplication and other comparison functions perform on varied kinds of sentences would be more interesting.","The reviewer acknowledges the contributions of the paper, noting the comparison of different methods and the performance improvements on various datasets. However, the reviewer also points out that the work is incremental and lacks innovation, suggesting that a qualitative evaluation would be more interesting. The language used is constructive and provides clear feedback without any harsh or disrespectful wording.",30,80
